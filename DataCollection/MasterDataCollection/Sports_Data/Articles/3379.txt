Sunderland completed its latest escape from relegation in the English Premier League on Wednesday — and consigned Newcastle, its bitter nearby rival, to the second tier in the process.A 3-0 win over visiting Everton guaranteed Sunderland safety with a game to spare and justified its decision to hire the survival specialist Sam Allardyce as manager in October.Under Allardyce, who has yet to be relegated from the English top flight in 25 years as a manager, Sunderland lost just one of its final 10 matches.“It’s pretty miraculous,” Allardyce said.Newcastle and Norwich join Aston Villa in going down just as the Premier League is to begin new domestic and international television deals worth a record $12 billion over the next three years.AdvertisementAllardyce said securing the club’s financial future was “the most important thing this season.”AdvertisementNorwich’s 4-2 victory over Watford proved to be in vain as Sunderland stayed four points ahead. Norwich lasted just one season back in the top flight.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Benítez was coaching Real Madrid at the start of the season and is one of the sport’s best-regarded managers — an unlikely candidate for a season in England’s second tier.“We are devastated at our relegation from the Premier League, as I know every single person connected to this football club will be,” said Lee Charnley, the Newcastle managing director. He called relegation a “massive disappointment and underachievement.”By forcing Newcastle’s relegation, Allardyce got a measure of revenge more than eight years after he was fired at St. James’ Park — just eight months into a three-year deal — after being criticized for his brand of soccer. And he got one over Benítez, with whom he has openly clashed through the years.The only things at stake in Sunday’s final round of Premier League games are the last Champions League qualification spot, between Manchester City, Manchester United and — at least mathematically — West Ham, and the Europa League berth.Elsewhere, Christian Benteke scored in the second minute of injury time to earn Liverpool a 1-1 draw against Chelsea. Eden Hazard had put Chelsea in front with his fourth goal in fourth games after what has been a disappointing campaign for last season’s player of the year in England.A version of this article appears in print on May 12, 2016, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Newcastle and Norwich Drop as Sunderland Survives.
