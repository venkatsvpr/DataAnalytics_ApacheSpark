He won his first clay-court titles last year in Munich and Madrid.“I’ve learned a lot from Amélie over the last two years, both on and off the court,” Murray said in the statement. “She’s been a calming influence in the team and we will all miss having her around.”Murray, ranked third, is heading into a busy period, with the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympics and the United States Open in the next four months.“I’ll take some time to consider the next steps and how we progress from here,” Murray said, “but I’d like to thank her for everything she has done. She’s been an invaluable member of the team.”Advertisement
