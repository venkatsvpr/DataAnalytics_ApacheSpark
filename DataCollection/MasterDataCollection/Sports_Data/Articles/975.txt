Collins kept Cespedes in the No. 3 spot and Cespedes hit the ball hard all game, with three singles in five at-bats.Collins shuffled other parts of the order, after the Mets had scored just twice in their previous three games. Among other moves, he bumped Michael Conforto to second — the highest spot he has ever started a game — even though Conforto was hitting .160 since the start of May.Conforto responded with a sacrifice fly off Jameson Taillon, a heralded prospect making his major league debut, in the fifth inning. Then Conforto smashed a game-tying two-run homer off Jared Hughes in the eighth. Ty Kelly also hit a two-run homer – his first home run in the majors – for the Mets’ first runs in the fourth inning.Mets starter Noah Syndergaard was not sharp, allowing seven hits and three runs (two earned) in six innings. He doubled and scored, though, and batted for himself in the seventh, after he had thrown his last pitch.Addison Reed pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth to earn the victory, and Jeurys Familia saved it despite walking three hitters in the 10th. Familia survived by inducing a double-play grounder from Sean Rodriguez, and striking out David Freese to end the game with the tying run on third.Advertisement
