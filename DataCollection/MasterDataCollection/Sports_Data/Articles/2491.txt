At No. 19, the Tar Heels (34-21) have the highest Rating Percentage Index of any team ever left out. The R.P.I. is one of several metrics the selection committee uses to determine at-large teams.Joel Erdmann, the selection committee’s chairman, said the Tar Heels were the first team left out after following an 18-2 start with a 16-19 finish and a fifth-place ranking, at 13-17, in the A.C.C.’s Coastal Division.“What makes it unique is they are within the top conference in the nation, but when you really break down their field of work, their résumé, they, within the conference, struggled a bit,” Erdmann said.Four teams are in for the first time as automatic qualifiers: Fairfield (32-24) of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, Alabama State (38-15) of the Southwestern Athletic Conference, Utah Valley (37-21) of the Western Athletic Conference, and St. Mary’s College of California (33-23) of the West Coast Conference.AdvertisementWestern Michigan (22-32) upset Kent State in the Mid-American Conference title game and was one of two teams that made it as automatic qualifiers with losing records.The other was Utah (25-27), which won the Pacific-12 Conference regular-season title — the league does not hold a conference tournament — with a 19-11 league mark. The Utes are in their fifth season in the Pac-12 and finished last in each of the previous four, never winning more than seven conference games.Erdmann said the final three teams picked for at-large bids were Southeastern Louisiana (39-19, No. 40 R.P.I.), Nebraska (37-20, No. 48) and South Alabama (40-20, No. 50). The next two teams left out after North Carolina were Oregon State (35-19, No. 44) and West Virginia (36-22, No. 61).A version of this article appears in print on May 31, 2016, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: SEC Sets A Record As 4 Teams Earn Seeds.
