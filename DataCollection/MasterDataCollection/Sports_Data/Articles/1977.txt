SPEEDWAY, Ind. — Every year, for decades, on the morning of the Indianapolis 500, the speedway historian Donald Davidson made it a tradition to walk from his home here to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is about a mile away.When Davidson decided to move here from his native England in 1964 to pursue his fascination with the Greatest Spectacle in Racing — as it was widely known then — he chose to live in Speedway, the town named for the racetrack within its borders.There was never any other real consideration for him.“I mean, where else would I live?” he said, grinning. “Speedway the town and the speedway itself have become my life.”Indeed, Davidson’s encyclopedic knowledge of the race, and more than a half-century of attending it and associating with its stars, is listed by some sources alongside the actress Joyce DeWitt (of “Three’s Company") among the town’s most notable residents. She merely lived here as a child; Davidson has been living in the same house here, within earshot of the epicenter of racing, for nearly five decades.
                Ahead of the 100th Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, nine past winners reminisced about what makes the race great.            Now 73 and somewhat hobbled by arthritis in his ankles, Davidson concedes that he has had to give up his neighborhood walk in favor of a ride. But he will always remember the ritual fondly. He would leave his home through the back gate, walking a few paces down a back alley onto 15th Street, then zigzag over toward 16th, where the speedway’s main entrance used to be. Davidson said he would be reminded what a grass-roots tradition the race was for so many others.Advertisement“You would see fathers and sons, families and friends carrying their picnic baskets and their blankets, their chair cushions, dragging their coolers; it was a very cool thing,” he said. “It was so all-American. I loved it, always did, still do.”AdvertisementBy the time he would reach the gates of the famed Brickyard, the trickle of friends and neighbors he started out with would integrate into an ever-larger throng of racegoers, who swelled this working-class town’s population, normally about 12,000 residents, to several hundred thousand.The speedway and the town were founded by Carl Fisher, who along with a group of partners bought a large tract of farmland five miles west of downtown Indianapolis in 1909. The two-and-a-half-mile racetrack was built first (and rebuilt again with a brick surface two years later, after an original base of cinders proved too destructive), and the first 500-mile race was held in 1911. The town was laid out a year later.Fisher envisioned the town as an experiment. He wanted to create a new kind of city: a 20th-century city populated by cars, not horses, as its primary mode of transportation. Not only would the residents build the cars and parts to supply greater Indianapolis’s burgeoning auto industry, they and the town would also produce inventions and innovations in transportation.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Practice days could draw 50,000; pole position qualifying might bring in 200,000. The race, for which official attendance figures were never given, drew an estimated 400,000, making it the largest single-day sporting event in the world.But in the last 20 years, the race and the sport of IndyCar racing itself have been in decline. A dispute between speedway management and the competitors for control of the sport devolved into boycotts, the split of sanctioning bodies and schedules, and the general flight of sponsors.Though the rift was healed over time, the sport’s recovery has been further slowed by a rocky economy. So the old wounds have been hard to heal, and the herds flocking to the speedway on race mornings have been thinned by more than the loss of Davidson.But this year, the indications were that the good old days may be back again.“This year, the town will be more like it was for many years, on race day at least, because of the huge amount of interest around this year’s 100th running of the 500,” Davidson said, adding, “This would be a good year to do the walk again.”AdvertisementSpeedway, the town built by a racetrack more than a century ago, was once again the center of the racing world.A version of this article appears in print on May 30, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Speedway, a Small Town, Mixes Yearly With a Big Race.
