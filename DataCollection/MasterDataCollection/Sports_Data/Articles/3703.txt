PARIS — In his quest to complete a career Grand Slam, Novak Djokovic could have to beat the nine-time champion Rafael Nadal in the French Open semifinals.The top-ranked Djokovic, who will face 100th-ranked Lu Yen-hsun in the first round, was put in the same side of the draw as Nadal on Friday. Djokovic beat Nadal in the quarterfinals last year, the second loss of Nadal’s career at Roland Garros.Stan Wawrinka, the defending champion, and Andy Murray could meet in the other semifinal.In the women’s draw, Serena Williams’s attempt to equal Steffi Graf’s Open-era record of 22 major titles includes a possible quarterfinal match against Victoria Azarenka.Djokovic, who has lost in the final in Paris in three of the last four years, is 37-3 this year but most recently lost to Murray in the Italian Open final. Finally winning the French Open would give him four consecutive major championships, something no man has achieved since Rod Laver won a true Grand Slam in 1969.AdvertisementMurray is seeded second for the first time at Roland Garros and will face a qualifier in his first match.“It’s only two days out from the start of the tournament, and I don’t know who I’m playing against yet,” Murray said of playing a qualifier. “So you don’t have as much time to start preparing for it, and that’s what makes it tricky.“The positives are that often a lot of the qualifiers maybe have not played on the bigger courts and stuff, and maybe you can capitalize a bit on that at the beginning, if they are a little bit nervous.”Because of Roger Federer’s withdrawal for an unspecified injury, Nadal was seeded No. 4, avoiding a possible quarterfinal rematch with Djokovic. Chasing his first major title since winning in Paris two years ago, Nadal takes on the big server Sam Groth in the first round.“I need to be ready to suffer a little bit during the match, because I know it’s going to be difficult to have breaks,” Nadal said.AdvertisementDjokovic should have few problems before the fourth round, where 14th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut could be waiting.Williams, the defending champion in Paris, will open against 76th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova.Before a potential quarterfinal match against Azarenka, the top-ranked Williams might also have to face Kristina Mladenovic and the former champion Ana Ivanovic. In the semifinals, Williams could then be pitted against third-seeded Angelique Kerber, who won her first Grand Slam title in January by beating Williams in the Australian Open final.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
