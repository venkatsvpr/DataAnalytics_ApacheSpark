Game 4 is scheduled for Monday night in Miami.Lowry was a career 34 percent playoff shooter before Saturday and was shooting 31 percent this postseason. But he connected Saturday on 11 of 19 shots and was 5 of 8 from 3-point range.“I’ve said this: He’s struggled, but you don’t forget how to shoot,” Toronto Coach Dwane Casey said. “And we needed that. We needed him to be Kyle, and he was Kyle tonight.”Lowry had 29 points after halftime. So did Wade, who by the end led with 38 points and sparked a Miami rally from 13 behind in the second half.But the Heat lost the game, and maybe much more after center Hassan Whiteside took a second-quarter tumble, injuring his right knee. Whiteside will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Sunday.Toronto center Jonas Valanciunas limped off with a sprained ankle in the third quarter, and he will be listed as day-to-day. But the injury sustained by Whiteside, a pending free agent, seemed worse, with his status for the rest of the series in doubt.“Guys have to step up,” Wade said. “Nobody can be Hassan Whiteside.” Advertisement
