BOSTON — Four days of rest and relaxation over the All-Star break may have left the Yankees rejuvenated after a month of misfortune, but it did little to change the way they played baseball.The Yankees returned from their break with a deflating 5-4 loss to the Boston Red Sox, who scored twice in the bottom of the ninth against closer Aroldis Chapman, with the winning run coming home on a bases-loaded walk.The defeat, their 19th in their last 26 games, dropped the Yankees to four and a half games behind the Red Sox in the American League East. On Saturday, they will have the tall task of facing Chris Sale, the American League starter in the All-Star Game.“If you want to win championships, you have to win those games,” Manager Joe Girardi said of Friday night’s meltdown.AdvertisementThe image of Chapman walking slowly off the mound toward the third-base dugout after missing wide to Andrew Benintendi, while the Red Sox celebrated on the field, was a hauntingly familiar one for the Yankees.AdvertisementIt recalled their visit here last September, when Hanley Ramirez hit a three-run, game-ending home run off Dellin Betances that started the Red Sox toward a four-game sweep that all but killed off the Yankees’ playoff hopes.For all the uncertainty that veiled the Yankees at the start of the season — How far could their youthful hitters carry them? How would the starting pitching hold up? — the Yankees at least felt they could be secure in their bullpen.In giving Chapman a five-year, $85 million contract, they were buying security in pairing him with the All-Star setup man Dellin Betances and the reliable veterans Tyler Clippard and Adam Warren at the back end of the bullpen.Those plans, though, have come unhinged.Yankees relievers have blown 18 saves this season — the most in the major leagues, two more than they did last season and six more than in 2015, when their 12 blown saves were the fewest in baseball.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In that span, he has faced 24 batters and retired half, striking out just six.AdvertisementHe was at a loss on Friday to explain why he can no longer throw the ball past hitters.“Actually, that’s a good question,” Chapman said through an interpreter. “I’m going to go back and try to see footage and see why, because honestly, I don’t know why.”Though he struggled to command his fastball, which topped out at 102 miles per hour, he did not turn to his slider or his changeup in any of his 23 pitches.“I just didn’t want to,” Chapman said.Chapman was not solely to blame for the Yankees’ undoing. He walked two and allowed two infield hits — one of which would have been turned into a forceout had shortstop Didi Gregorius’s throw not pulled second baseman Ronald Torreyes off the bag. That put Mookie Betts, who had reached on an infield single, on second base and Dustin Pedroia on first.They took advantage of Chapman’s inattentiveness to steal second and third, which allowed Betts to tie the score at 4 when Torreyes booted a grounder by Xander Bogaerts.“It’s a routine ground ball that I’m used to making,” Torreyes said of the grounder.After Ramirez, who earlier hit a two-run homer off starter Jordan Montgomery, was intentionally walked, Chapman walked Benintendi on five pitches.Until the late collapse, it was the bullpen that had put the Yankees in position to win. After Gary Sanchez had given the Yankees a 4-3 lead with a two-run homer in the fifth, Chad Green, Warren and Betances had shut down the Red Sox for four innings, striking out nine along the way.But the final three outs never came.A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2017, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Chapman Lifts Red Sox by Walking In Winning Run.
