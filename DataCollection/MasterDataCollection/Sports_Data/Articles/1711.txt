Six weeks away from competition did not keep Dustin Johnson from extending one streak Thursday, with hopes of adding to another. Johnson showed more game than rust at the Wells Fargo Championship, where he missed only two greens — and plenty of putts — for a two-under-par 70 that left him four shots behind the leader Francesco Molinari at blustery Eagle Point Golf Club in Wilmington, N.C. It was Johnson’s 13th consecutive round at par or better.Johnson was not as flawless as he looked while winning three straight tournaments, though he had few complaints under the circumstances. It was his first time playing since he slipped in his socks down the stairs at his rental house in Augusta, Ga., hurting his back and knocking himself out of the Masters.“Since I hadn’t played in so long, I’m happy with the way I played,” Johnson said. “I didn’t score that great, didn’t really hole that many putts, but other than that, I played really well. I think I hit 16 greens, and I hit the ball great.”On greens that were slightly softer and as pure as can be, Molinari ran off five birdies in a seven-hole stretch on the front nine and closed out his round with a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th. That gave him a one-shot lead over Alex Noren of Sweden, J. B. Holmes, Grayson Murray and Brian Campbell.AdvertisementKO WINS IN MATCH PLAY Lydia Ko beat the home favorite Ana Menendez, and the Jutanugarn sisters set up a second-round showdown in the Lorena Ochoa Match Play in Mexico City.

The deal would have locked her into the circuit through the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo. In her first public comments since breaking with the tour, Walsh Jennings said that the deal was “a death sentence for our sport.” The decision to opt out of the AVP tour also means Walsh Jennings will split with April Ross, her partner in Rio de Janeiro, where they won the Olympic bronze medal.AdvertisementPittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby is skating again, but Coach Mike Sullivan provided no update on when his star would be ready to return from a concussion.
