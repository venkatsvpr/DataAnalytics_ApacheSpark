The Washington Nationals have taken the pitching prize of the next free-agent class off the market. The team agreed to a seven-year, $175 million contract with the right-hander Stephen Strasburg, locking up an important part of one of the majors’ best rotations.The agreement was confirmed by a person in baseball with direct knowledge of the deal who insisted upon anonymity because the team has not announced it. The contract was first reported by The Washington Post.Strasburg, 27, can opt out of the deal after the third or fourth seasons. But by signing now, he takes himself out of a thin class of free-agent starters that is scheduled to include Andrew Cashner, Bartolo Colon, R. A. Dickey, Jeremy Hellickson, Rich Hill, Ivan Nova and Scott Kazmir, if he exercises an opt-out clause.Strasburg is 5-0 with a 2.76 E.R.A. this season, throwing 58 strikeouts in 49 innings. He led the National League in strikeouts in 2014 and was the first overall pick in the 2009 draft.
