As duckpin bowling inexorably fades away, the sport’s top woman and a few dozen certified alleys endure.By DAN BARRYMAY 26, 2016
PITTSFIELD, Mass. — The world’s best female duckpin bowler holds so many bowling records that she has lost count, but her game-day shirt features a star for each of her tournament wins — a sartorial requirement of the Women’s National Duckpin Association. With 19 stars so far, her polyester constellation is running out of sky.The world’s best female duckpin bowler lives here in the Berkshires, where duckpin bowling is neither played nor followed. If she wants to bowl, she must drive two hours to an alley in Connecticut, where bowlers sometimes ask her for shared selfies and autographs.The world’s best female duckpin bowler is Amy Bisson Sykes, a slight woman of 37 who dominates a black-and-white pastime in a Technicolor world. Her sport is so yesterday that whenever another duckpin alley closes, the remaining alley owners descend like predatory relatives to cart off the mechanical parts of duckpin setting machines that have not been made in two generations.But Bisson Sykes was reared in the duckpin bowling alley her father owned in Newington, Conn., amid the drone of rolling balls on pine and maple, the clatter of pins scattering like startled waterfowl. The soundtrack of her youth.AdvertisementIn leagues and tournaments, Bisson Sykes used to slip into an all-business cocoon that others found intimidating and even off-putting. Wearing the mask of singular purpose, she would stand with the same red-and-white ball firm in her right hand and raised close to her chest and then release it with the twinning of a ballerina’s curtsy and a fencer’s thrust.Advertisement“I was there to win,” she said.The cognoscenti of duckpin often pause before describing Bisson Sykes’s talent and impact, as if searching for the proper superlative.“Phenomenal,” said Al Zoraian, the president of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress.“Not unbeatable,” added Lauree Schreiber, a friend and longtime opponent. “But she’s about as close as it gets.”Bisson Sykes has retained much of her intense focus on the 10-pin triangle. But motherhood has taught her that the lanes of life are curlicue, with pins that can move about and refuse to fall. Now she offers high-fives to opponents who throw strikes and embraces the sense of community that has always enveloped the ancient game of bowling.
CreditJessica Hill for The New York Times        It’s been an epiphany. Turns out some things in life are even more important than duckpin bowling.To all those armchair athletes rolling their eyes instead of balls, let’s be clear: Odds are, you’d be lousy at duckpin.The grapefruit-size ball weighs less than four pounds and has no finger holes, and the squat duckpins look like out-of-shape cousins to the more familiar bowling pin. And even though a turn can include throwing three balls, instead of the two in the more common game of tenpin bowling, scores are still much lower.According to the United States Bowling Congress, there were 55,266 certified 300 games — that is, 12 consecutive strikes, for a perfect score — in the 2013-14 season of tenpin bowling. But there has never been a 300 game in duckpin bowling. As all serious duckpinners know, a Connecticut man named Pete Signore Jr. came closest in 1992, bowling a 279.The history of duckpin is a murky pond. It was long believed that the game emerged around 1900 from a Baltimore gaming hall owned by John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson, future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. But research has since found references to duckpin dating to the early 1890s, in New Haven, Boston and Lowell, Mass.AdvertisementThe sport became popular along the Eastern Seaboard, finding particular passion in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maryland. Men now gray and halting in step will recall their glory years as pin boys, setting pins and clearing deadwood for the greats: Harry Kraus and Wolfie Wolfensberger and the singular Nick Tronsky, out of Connecticut. And don’t forget the female standouts: Toots Barger and Sis Atkinson and Cathy Dyak.Big matches drew standing-room-only crowds. Local newspapers chronicled the scores and profiled the stars (“Nick Tronsky of New Britain stole the show at the state duckpin tournament today with a nine-game total of 1,203”). Companies hired ringers for their league teams, and some stars barnstormed, taking on all local heroes. In certain American crannies, duckpin was life.Some pastimes just fade away, to resurface only with the smirk of irony. Like so many other endeavors, duckpin has been a casualty of the fundamental change in how Americans choose to spend their leisure time. But some of the duckpin faithful will also cite what is known as the Curse of Ken Sherman.In 1953, a submarine designer named Kenneth Sherman invented an automatic pinsetter for duckpin. It was an elaborate, Rube Goldberg-like contraption of more than 1,000 moving parts — cast-iron gears and gaskets and pin holders — that did away with the need for pin boys and made the game faster and more efficient.But the story goes that when Sherman’s company stopped operating nearly 50 years ago, he refused to sell the patent for the Sherman Pinsetter to Brunswick Equipment — some say because he feared that Brunswick would end production so that duckpin could no longer compete with tenpin.“But we’re in the same situation as if Brunswick had shut us down anyway,” said Stan Kellum, 72, the executive director of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress, which is run out of a small office in a Maryland bowling alley. “Nobody is manufacturing the machines.”That is why, if you go behind the lanes at, say, Highland Bowl, in Cheshire, Conn., the back wall is lined with cardboard boxes crammed with cast-iron bits, duckpin nests and assorted other parts no longer manufactured — all scavenged and saved from closed alleys.When all 20 lanes are operating smoothly, the deafening roar is mere background music for the owner, Todd Turcotte. But his ears are attuned to the faintest false note in the mechanical syncopation. When that happens, something is broken — off.AdvertisementAnd what does Turcotte do then? “Pray,” he said.His situation reflects why the game of duckpin could not grow. No new automatic pinsetters means no new alleys.Today there are 41 congress-certified duckpin bowling alleys, down from nearly 450 in 1963, Kellum said, “and we’re losing houses all over the place.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

By 15, she had a junior-level reputation as a fierce competitor with the exceptional hand-eye coordination required to consistently knock down a stubborn last pin 60 feet away. The junior records piled up: highest game (262); highest three-game set (567); highest average (145).She played softball at American International College in Springfield, Mass.; graduated with a degree in elementary education; and promptly joined the professional duckpin tour. Reaching the finals of her first tournament, at Perillo’s Bowl-O-Drome in Waterbury, Conn., she faced an estimable opponent, Lynne Heller, a Hall of Famer who had recently bowled a 200 game.Into that cocoon she slipped. All business. She won the tournament and, soon, a reputation.A couple of years later, she wound up being matched with another bowler through the entirety of a weekend tournament. At the end of it, the other woman said she was glad to have spent time with her, adding, “You’re not the bitch that people say you are.”Bisson Sykes remembers the moment as if it were yesterday: at Pinland Bowling Lanes, just outside Baltimore. “Back then, I probably just closed myself off to that,” she said. “I was just there to bowl. But I think people took me as cocky.”AdvertisementThe tournament wins and records kept piling up. Then, in 2007, she met Stephen Sykes, a financial adviser, through mutual friends. Coming from Pittsfield in the Berkshires, he knew little of duckpin bowling and nothing of the superstar status of the woman he was now dating.They married and moved to Pittsfield, just 60 miles — and a duckpin chasm — away from her father’s alley in Newington. “I thought I could handle it,” Bisson Sykes said. “I didn’t think that it would have the impact that it did.”She gave birth to her first son, Benjamin, in 2009. Returned to the tour in 2010 and was named female bowler of the year (one of at least eight such honors). Gave birth to her second, Nathan, in 2011. And was named bowler of the year in 2012.That same year, her father died, unexpectedly, at 65. He took a cup of coffee to his work area at the back of the lanes, where all those Sherman Pinsetters were clacking and whirring, and collapsed.And the next year, in the spring of 2013, her younger son, Nathan, was found to have a brain tumor. After two brain operations and who knows how many consultations — a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, a neuro-oncologist, a neuro-ophthalmologist — it was determined that the tumor, sitting on his brainstem, was inoperable.These days, no news is good news. Nathan was undergoing magnetic resonance imaging every few months, but now he has yearly intervals between scans and is monitored by doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He attends preschool, sings, dances and trails after his older, protective brother.“A goofball, a spitfire,” Bisson Sykes said of Nathan. “He lights up the room.”As Nathan, 4, illuminated a room in the Sykeses’ house, and as Benjamin, 6, dueled imaginary demons with his Star Wars saber, their mother went down to the basement. There, inside several plastic tubs stacked in a far corner, were the trophies and plaques that state her case as the world’s best female duckpin bowler. Once on display upstairs, they lost out to the playthings of children.Reading through a couple of old newspaper clippings, Bisson Sykes mourned a pastime inexorably slipping into memory. Here was an article featuring T-Bowl, her father’s bowling alley. Closed last year, it is now a furniture store.Advertisement“So many places are closing,” Bisson Sykes said. “People just don’t come out to bowl. Where is everybody going?”Bisson Sykes knows at least where she will be for the Memorial Day weekend: at Turner’s Dual Lanes, in Hagerstown, Md., for the first tour stop of the women’s 2016 season. She has already paid her $115 entry fee.She will be wearing a rubber bracelet on her right wrist that reads, “Nate the Great.” And in her travel bag she will have all the essentials for a duckpin assassin:The red-and-white ball she has carried with her since she was 12. Two other balls. A pair of Dexter bowling shoes, with the toe bottom worn away on the right shoe from so many follow-through curtsies. And a gray bowling shirt adorned with 19 stars.It’s not the same as it was, of course. When she turned professional 16 years ago, she’d see 80, maybe 100 women competing in a tour. Now, maybe half that.But she will enjoy herself, catching up with friendly adversaries, visiting an outlet mall, going to dinner with a few close duckpin pals. And when it’s time, she will lose herself in the fading, therapeutic endeavor of throwing a ball to knock things down.A version of this article appears in print on May 29, 2016, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Still Standing, Precariously.
