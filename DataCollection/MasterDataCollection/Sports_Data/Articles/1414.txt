PARAMUS, N.J. — Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh wore his trademark block-M baseball cap, long-sleeved shirt and khakis on Wednesday as he stood in the cafeteria at Paramus Catholic High School, but he also carried a pinstriped jersey in one hand.“Oh, going Jeter today,” said the Michigan quarterbacks coach Jedd Fisch, a reference to the former Yankees shortstop (and onetime near-Wolverine).The sartorial strategy was nothing new. At an earlier appearance at a football camp in Baltimore, Harbaugh wore a Ray Lewis jersey alongside his brother, John Harbaugh, the Ravens’ coach. At a camp in Atlanta, Jim Harbaugh wore a Hank Aaron jersey in an appearance with Aaron himself.But at a camp last summer in Prattville, Ala. — about a two-hour drive from the campus office of Alabama Coach Nick Saban — Harbaugh made news when he wore no shirt at all. Instead, a few months after Michigan’s bitter foe Ohio State won the national title, he stripped off his shirt while throwing a ball around with campers.Advertisement“I’ve been in Alabama in the summer,” said Brendan Huffman, Scout.com’s national recruiting director. “It’s hot. You think Harbaugh took his shirt off just because he thought it was hot, or do you think Harbaugh thought, ‘My rival’s just won the national championship; I need people talking about Michigan’?”AdvertisementEverywhere he goes these days, Michigan is what Harbaugh is selling. On Wednesday, his tour brought him to the Next Level Football Camp at Paramus Catholic, a New Jersey school that has been very good to Michigan in recent years. The four-hour event was one of a series of satellite camps, off-site informal practices designed to put precollege players together with college coaches for football instruction — and, just maybe, the kind of explosive performance in football drills that could lead to a scholarship offer.Wednesday’s camp featured more than 600 players and coaches from several dozen colleges, top powers like Michigan and Pitt and less-heralded teams like Stonehill and Villanova. It was the latest of more than three dozen such camps that Harbaugh or members of his staff will attend this year as he continues an energetic, aggressive and nonstop campaign to challenge college football’s established powers.Since bursting back onto the college football landscape in January 2015 after four years with the San Francisco 49ers, Harbaugh, a former Michigan quarterback, has attacked the job of restoring his alma mater to greatness with what he once called “enthusiasm unknown to mankind.”In less than two years, that has meant launching stunts designed to implant the brand of Wolverines football into the hearts and minds of 17-year-old prospects: not only a succession of camps like Wednesday’s, but also a national signing day ceremony that featured Jeter and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, as well as a succession of impolitic, trolling Twitter posts aimed at some of his biggest competitors.While Harbaugh’s rivals cast him as an outlaw for such stunts — Saban compared the situation to “the wild, wild West” — a more appropriate term is the one used in modern business: He is a disrupter.His visit to Paramus Catholic, for example, came a week after he dominated a whole college football news cycle with a single Twitter post — a response to Saban, college football’s reigning king, who had unleashed a tirade condemning satellite camps like Wednesday’s. Saban had said he worried that the camps involved “third parties” in the recruiting process in a manner that could lead to N.C.A.A. violations.
            "Amazing" to me- Alabama broke NCAA rules & now their HC is lecturing us on the possibility of rules being broken at camps. Truly "amazing."        “Alabama broke NCAA rules & now their HC is lecturing us on the possibility of rules being broken at camps,” Harbaugh wrote on Twitter in an apparent reference to accusations against the former Alabama assistant Bo Davis, who had just resigned.AdvertisementThe exchange was similar to Harbaugh’s reaction earlier this year when Tennessee Coach Butch Jones and Georgia Coach Kirby Smart separately questioned Harbaugh’s decision to hold Michigan practices over spring break at IMG Academy, an elite football-focused prep school in Bradenton, Fla.“If the Georgia coach is implying any intent on our part to break rules,” Harbaugh posted in February, “he is barking up the wrong tree.” (Georgia’s nickname is the Bulldogs.)Len Middleton, a lecturer at Michigan’s business school, described Harbaugh’s style — and his elbows-out tactics in service of Michigan football — as “innovative.”“That’s what makes great entrepreneurs,” Middleton said. “They’re questioning: ‘Why are we following this path? Why can’t we follow the next path?’”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But, Foster said, Harbaugh had done as much to innovate as the N.C.A.A. permitted.“Within those guidelines, coaches try to differentiate themselves,” Foster said, adding, “Jim Harbaugh on the recruiting angle is a magnet for high school kids wanting to get really excited and enthused.”If anyone was excited and enthused before Wednesday’s camp began in the late afternoon, it was Harbaugh. During a planning session with coaches, he nervously craned his broad frame toward the door to see if storm clouds had moved on. Addressing the players and their parents later in a gym, he paced with the microphone like a talk-show host and shouted, “My heart is pounding right now!” He compared the way he felt to a thoroughbred before the Kentucky Derby; to a boxer before a fight; and to himself before he coached in the Super Bowl.But avoiding a Michigan-centric pitch before a crowd that also included an N.C.A.A. representative, he mostly stuck to general encouragement: “I know you’re all here to show what you can do — and have at it!”In Harbaugh’s continuing challenge to college football’s established hierarchy, the satellite camps are perhaps the clearest case study in how he has tested boundaries, provoked a backlash and ultimately won out.AdvertisementAs recently as two years ago, camps like the one in Paramus were lightly attended and little discussed. The camps, in which college coaching staffs give a few hours’ instruction at a location far from campus, do not violate N.C.A.A. rules as long as they are nominally hosted by a local institution — a high school, a smaller college, a nonprofit group, even an individual trainer — and ostensibly devoted to instruction.Although they are held all over the country, they are particularly desirable for coaches whose teams do not play near recruiting hotbeds. Recruiting’s most fertile crescent stretches from Dallas and Houston through the Deep South and down to southern Florida, and the two conferences whose traditional universities reside there, the Southeastern and the Atlantic Coast, had both previously restricted their members from participating in satellite camps in an effort to discourage them from cannibalizing one another’s natural recruiting bases.But when the Division I Council, which helps govern the 10 top football conferences, banned satellite camps in April, a fierce backlash ensued. Stories emerged of recruits who credited camps for their scholarships; Northern coaches pleaded with their athletic directors to fight for the camps’ reinstatement; and there was even a stray suggestion that the Department of Justice would investigate on antitrust grounds.By the end of April, the N.C.A.A. Board of Directors reversed the prohibition, prompting the SEC and the A.C.C. — fearful of losing ground to interlopers like Harbaugh — to vote to lift their own bans.Last week, Louisiana State’s Les Miles held his program’s first camp. On Wednesday, Ohio State’s Urban Meyer was scheduled to attend a camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J., not far from Paramus.And among the colleges that sent coaches to the Paramus Catholic camp was one more notable program: Alabama.“He’s only been there a short time,” Paramus Catholic Coach Dan Sabella said of Harbaugh last week. “He’s getting a lot of people taking about him and his program, bringing a lot of attention, which only helps with recruiting. I would say it’s been effective.”A version of this article appears in print on June 9, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Michigan’s Disrupter Barnstorms Nation.
