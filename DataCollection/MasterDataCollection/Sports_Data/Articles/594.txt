OAKLAND, Calif. — The N.B.A. suspended the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green for Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals on Monday as a result of an accumulation of flagrant fouls over the course of the postseason.The N.B.A. announced Sunday that the league had retroactively assessed Green with a flagrant foul 1 for striking the Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James in the groin during the fourth quarter of the Warriors’ Game 4 victory on Friday, triggering an automatic one-game suspension, per league rules.Four flagrant foul “points” in the postseason results in a suspension. Green, who plays an outsize role for the Warriors as a do-everything point forward, already had three.“The cumulative points system is designed to deter flagrant fouls in our game,” Kiki Vandeweghe, the N.B.A.’s executive vice president for basketball operations, said in a statement. “While Draymond Green’s actions in Game 4 do not merit a suspension as a stand-alone act, the number of flagrant points he has earned triggers a suspension for Game 5.”The Warriors, who will host Game 5, have a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
