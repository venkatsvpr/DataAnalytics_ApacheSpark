Manchester City’s priority on Sunday was securing fourth place in England’s Premier League to qualify for the Champions League.In Manuel Pellegrini’s last league match in charge, City tied host Swansea, 1-1, but a 19-goal difference means it cannot realistically be caught by its rival Manchester United, which is 3 points back in the standings with a game to play.At United’s stadium, Old Trafford, the police dismantled a fake bomb on what was supposed to be the final day of the league’s season. The threat forced the cancellation of United’s game, against Bournemouth, before it began.The game was rescheduled for Tuesday night in Manchester.Leicester, already crowned the top-tier champion for the first time in the club’s 132-year history, completed its season with a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.AdvertisementA feud simmering since Jose Bautista’s bat flip in an American League division series last year boiled over into a wild brawl in the final game of the season between Toronto and Texas, a 7-6 victory for the host Rangers.AdvertisementBautista, of Toronto, and Texas second baseman Rougned Odor got into a fistfight behind the bag after a hard slide by Bautista in the eighth inning. Players from both teams rushed the field as Odor landed the first punch to Bautista’s face.“I was pretty surprised,” Bautista said. “I mean, obviously, that’s the only reason that he got me, and he got me pretty good, so I have to give him that. It takes a little bit bigger man to knock me down.”Odor was not available for comment after the game.Umpires needed about 10 minutes to restore order, and Blue Jays reliever Jesse Chavez hit Prince Fielder with the next pitch when the game resumed. He was ejected, with both teams having been warned when Bautista was hit by a pitch from Matt Bush.Toronto Manager John Gibbons accounted for one of eight ejections from the game, after an argument in the third inning, but he was back on the field during the brawl. The first-base coach Tim Leiper was tossed in a separate argument in the third, and the bench coach DeMarlo Hale, filling in for Gibbons, was ejected when Chavez (0-1) hit Fielder.Ian Desmond hit a three-run homer in the seventh to give Bush, a 30-year-old rookie, his first major league win two days after he made his major league debut.Athletic hits three homers Danny Valencia hit three home runs, including a two-run shot in the ninth inning, as visiting Oakland edged the Tampa Bay Rays, 7-6.Matt Kenseth held off Kyle Larson in a thrilling run down the stretch to win the crash-filled AAA 400 at Dover International Speedway in Delaware.AdvertisementKenseth raced to his first Sprint Cup victory of the season and denied Larson his first career win.Kenseth and Larson battled for parts of the final five laps, and Kenseth, the 2003 Nascar champion, picked all the right lines and pulled away at the end. Chase Elliott finished third, the top finish of his rookie season. Larson matched his career-best finish.Teenager wins in Spain Max Verstappen of Red Bull became Formula One’s youngest race winner at age 18 with a victory at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona. The Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, the favorites, had crashed into each other on the first lap.Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari was second, and his teammate Sebastian Vettel third.The title defense of the heavyweight Deontay Wilder against the Russian challenger Alexander Povetkin was postponed by the World Boxing Council after Povetkin failed a drug test. Wilder’s promoter said the fight could be canceled altogether.The W.B.C. said the fight, which had been set for May 21 in Moscow, was off, pending an investigation, with no backup date.Povetkin’s promoter said the substance found in the test, in April, was meldonium.Wilder, a 36-0 American, was to make his fourth defense of the belt he won against Bermane Stiverne in January 2015. For Povetkin (30-1), it was to be his first world title challenge since losing a unanimous decision to Wladimir Klitschko in 2013.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In no other walk of life would this happen.”The accusations of an elaborate drug operation at the 2014 Winter Olympics, published last week in The New York Times, have led to growing calls to bar Russia and its powerhouse track and field team from the Rio Games, which are set to open in August.MIKE McPHATEA version of this article appears in print on May 16, 2016, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Manchester City All but Secures Top-4 Finish.
