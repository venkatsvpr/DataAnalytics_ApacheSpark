Brazil was missing several top players, most notably its captain, Neymar.Brazil’s Philippe Coutinho forced a corner from close, and Ecuador’s Lucas Lima had a glancing header that could not find the target.Paolo Guerrero passed Teófilo Cubillas as his country’s top goal scorer with a diving header to give Peru a 1-0 win over Haiti in Seattle.Guerrero, 32, who the leading scorer in the 2011 and 2015 editions of the Copa América, powered home Edison Flores’s cross as Peru opened its Group B campaign with a win.Flores had a chance to give Peru a lead late in the first half, but his fierce shot caromed off the goal frame. Peru increased the tempo in the second half, and only a fine block by the Haiti goalkeeper and captain Johny Placide denied Renzo Revoredo in the 59th minute.Two-time champion Paraguay was held to a scoreless draw by Costa Rica in sultry conditions in Orlando, Fla.Costa Rica ended the game with 10 men after defender Kendall Waston was sent off in injury time for a wild challenge on Nelson Valdez. He will be suspended for Tuesday’s game in Chicago against the United States.The result left Colombia, which beat the United States on Friday, alone at the top of Group A.The intense heat and humidity — the temperature at kickoff was around 92 degrees — was blamed by both teams for what was, in the end, a disappointing spectacle in front of a disappointingly small crowd of 14,334.Paraguay Coach Ramón Díaz said it was “crazy” to have scheduled the match for 5 p.m.“The needs of players need to be taken into account; they are the ones who put on the spectacle,” he said.Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz agreed, saying: “The heat definitely affected the game. It could have been a much better game in different conditions.”The tournament faces a mounting injury crisis after Colombia’s James Rodríguez joined the Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez among the ranks of the walking wounded.Rodríguez left the field clutching his shoulder in the second half of Colombia’s win over the United States.But Colombia Coach José Pékerman was cautiously optimistic that Rodríguez’s injury would not keep him out of Tuesday’s game with Paraguay at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.Messi, the Argentina captain, is the biggest name hampered by injury. He has struggled with a back problem. Suárez is in doubt for Uruguay’s opener against Mexico on Sunday in Glendale, Ariz., because of a hamstring problem. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE)Advertisement
