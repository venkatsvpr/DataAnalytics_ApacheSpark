Having interviewed six candidates to fill their managerial vacancy, the Yankees now appear ready to move to the next phase and decide which of the six should get the job.General Manager Brian Cashman, who has been in charge of the search to find a replacement for Joe Girardi, told reporters on Friday that the interviewing was over and that “it’s time to make a recommendation to ownership and go from there.’’Cashman spoke in Stamford, Conn., where he was rehearsing for his annual Christmas holiday adventure in which he rappels down the city’s Landmark Building. Finding a new manager would actually seem to be less daunting.In his remarks to reporters, Cashman disclosed that he had reached out to the former Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez for input while conducting his managerial interviews, but that Rodriguez, himself, was not a candidate.AdvertisementIn his long and often controversial tenure with the Yankees, Rodriguez was frequently a huge distraction for Cashman, but that seems to be in the past. In recent years, Rodriguez has emerged as an impressive baseball analyst for Fox Sports, and Cashman apparently thought enough of his insights to consult him.Advertisement“Alex knows baseball as well as anybody,’’ Cashman told reporters.Rodriguez has a much bigger profile than the candidates now in the running — with the possible exception of Carlos Beltran, who recently retired after two decades as a standout major leaguer and was the last of the six hopefuls to be interviewed.The other five candidates are Chris Woodward, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ third-base coach; the broadcaster Aaron Boone, a Yankees hero in the 2003 postseason; Rob Thomson, the Yankees’ bench coach; Eric Wedge, the former manager of the Cleveland Indians and the Seattle Mariners; and Hensley Meulens, the hitting coach for the San Francisco Giants.Of the six, only Wedge has previous experience as a manager.Whether the Yankees make a final decision on a new manager by the time baseball’s winter meetings begin on Dec. 11 remains to be seen. The meetings are a traditional setting for trades and free-agent negotiations, but in an era in which analytics-driven front offices have become increasingly assertive, it is not clear whether Cashman feels it is necessary to have a new manager’s input during the meetings.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
