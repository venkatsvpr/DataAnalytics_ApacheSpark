Madoff, the former stockbroker who pleaded guilty in 2009 to running a vast Ponzi scheme. The payments would settle a lawsuit filed against the team’s owners by the trustee in 2010.The trustee also granted the owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, some financial relief by revising the settlement. The payment due on or before Wednesday was reduced from $23.3 million to $16 million, and the final payment of $45 million will be divided into four annual installments beginning in 2017.According to a statement by the trustee Irving H. Picard, Wilpon and Katz will pay an interest rate of 3.5 percent on the unpaid balance of the $45 million. Picard said the interest payments could add at least $2.2 million to repay Madoff’s customers.Before the agreement was changed, Wilpon and Katz had been scheduled to pay $37.9 million by June 1, 2017.The trustee’s website showed that Katz and Wilpon asked to modify the settlement during the spring. No reason is cited for their request to change the payment schedule. Through a Mets spokesman, they declined to comment.Under the original five-year settlement, Wilpon and Katz owed a maximum of $162 million. But they were always likely to see that $162 million reduced through the trustee’s efforts to recover the $17.5 billion lost in Madoff’s Ponzi scheme.To date, the recoveries have winnowed what they owe to $61 million, which is expected to be reduced further as more money is recovered.Advertisement
