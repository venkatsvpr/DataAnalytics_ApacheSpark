She converted three of her four break points.“Being in the quarterfinals here again is quite special,” said Sharapova, who won the event three times from 2012 to 2014.Less than 24 hours after beating Roberta Vinci in straight sets in her highly anticipated first match, Sharapova said that she “felt I settled down a little bit.”“I was able to focus on the game,” she added. “I executed a great plan today, and I thought I was solid.”Sharapova, who tested positive for the banned substance meldonium at last year’s Australian Open, held off the only break point for Makarova at 5-5, then broke Makarova in the next game to close out the opening set.Sharapova was in control of the second throughout and wrapped up the win with two straight aces to raise her total for the tournament to 20. She improved to 7-0 against Makarova.A five-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1, Sharapova lost her ranking because of the suspension and entered the event as a wild card.
