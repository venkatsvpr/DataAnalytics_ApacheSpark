Gordie Howe was known to generations of players and fans as Mr. Hockey.But after his death at age 88, many in the hockey world were remembering him as something else: Mr. Nice Guy.For all the tales of Howe’s on-ice toughness — the elbows, the hard checks — it was his unassuming kindness off the ice that so many recalled.“Unfortunately, we lost the greatest hockey player ever today, but more importantly, the nicest man I have ever met,” Wayne Gretzky, hockey’s Great One, wrote on Twitter.
            Unfortunately we lost the greatest hockey player ever today, but more importantly the nicest man I have ever met. (1/2)        
            Sending our thoughts and prayers to the Howe family and to the millions of hockey fans who like me loved Gordie Howe. RIP Mr. Hockey. (2/2)        The word “gentleman” was used again and again by those around hockey to describe Howe.“A great player in a sport that is our favorite sport in this country,” Brendan Shanahan, a former Red Wings player who is now the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, told The Toronto Star. “Then, on the flip side, when he got off the ice, he was a kind gentleman.”AdvertisementTony Granato, a former Red Wings assistant coach, called Howe “a gentleman, a true gentleman” and “the nicest man you could ever meet.”AdvertisementThat was not to say that hockey people were not still marveling at Howe’s accomplishments — 26 seasons in the N.H.L. and six more in the World Hockey Association, across five decades. He held the goal-scoring record until Gretzky came along.“I pick Gordie as my No. 1 all-time player,” said Scotty Bowman, who won nine Stanley Cups as a coach, including three with Detroit.Barry Melrose, a former player and current broadcaster, recalled on ESPN, “He was a guy who would hurt you physically, and score two goals to beat you.”

The guy was just a freak of nature to be playing that good at that age.”Howe still holds the N.H.L. record for regular-season games played, with 1,767 over 26 seasons. The league plans to honor Howe before Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday night.“Gordie’s toughness as a competitor on the ice was equaled only by his humor and humility away from it.,” N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “No sport could have hoped for a greater, more beloved ambassador.”Few were surprised by Howe’s passing. He had received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012 and had a serious stroke in 2014.AdvertisementNevertheless, the news hit his hometown, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, hard. Flags in the city — which is near Floral, the small unincorporated town where Howe was born — were flying at half-staff on Friday. A banner with Howe’s No. 9 was flying over the city’s ice arena, where fans were leaving flowers, cards, teddy bears and other mementos at a statue of Howe.“There’s a real feeling of sadness in the city because, even though Gordie played in Detroit, we still know he was from here, and he always kept that connection to Saskatoon and still has family here,” said Kevin Mitchell, a reporter at The StarPhoenix, the city’s daily newspaper.Howe’s stature loomed over the Detroit Red Wings, for whom he played 25 seasons, beginning in 1946, and won four Stanley Cups.In Detroit, some Red Wings fans gathered at Joe Louis Arena, the stadium named for the only other local athlete who can stand with Howe in the estimation of many Detroiters.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

John Bacon, a best-selling sportswriter, eulogized Howe for National Public Radio, crediting him for playing a key role in popularizing hockey in the United States.“When he was in his heyday, it was Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr and Bobby Hull,” Bacon said. “When those three guys were playing, rinks started popping up where they were playing.”In Bacon’s view, that “laid the groundwork for the 1980 Miracle on Ice.”Speaking in Detroit, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said Howe had been both a gentleman and a tough guy — “the best of what Canadians like to think of themselves as.”From Washington, President Obama said in a statement that Howe’s perseverance and humility personified Detroit.Advertisement“The greatest players define their game for a generation; over more than half a century on the ice, Mr. Hockey defined it for a lifetime,” Obama said.After Howe’s playing days were over, he was a regular visitor to Red Wings games and team events, including charity fund-raisers and Stanley Cup celebrations.“He embodied, on and off the ice, what it meant to be both a Red Wing and a Detroiter,” the Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch said in a statement. “He was tough, skilled, and consistently earned success at the highest level.”Granato, who played for the Rangers, the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose Sharks, remembered the effect of Howe’s presence.Praise for Gordie Howe flowed in Detroit, where he played 25 seasons, after news of his death.“He’d come to Joe Louis, and when the guys heard he was in the building, everyone perked up,” Granato said. “I’m thankful I had the chance to shake his hand a few times.”Once, when Granato was in Detroit as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins, he noticed Howe outside the visitor’s dressing room and introduced himself.He was surprised that Howe, a giant of the game, politely asked whether Granato might do him a favor.“Do you think I can go back and say hi to the kid?” Howe asked, referring to Pittsburgh’s then-budding star, Sidney Crosby.AdvertisementThe news of Howe’s death spread quickly among former Red Wings players, who, no matter what era they played in, seemed to come to know him.Dave Shand, who played hockey at the University of Michigan and broke into the N.H.L. in 1976, while Howe was still playing, said emails with news of Howe’s death had spread rapidly among former Red Wings players Friday morning.Shand recalled going up against Howe in a game in 1979, and Howe giving Shand an elbow to the face. The moment of impact was caught by a photographer.“It literally looked like half my face was pushed in,” Shand said with a laugh.Years later, after a stint with the Wings, Shand came to know Howe fairly well, and they used to joke about the play.“He was the most approachable superstar you’d ever run into,” Shand said. “He never made you feel like you were bothering him.”An earlier version of this article misstated the position of Brendan Shanahan with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He is the team’s president, not general manager.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
