Starr has been Baylor’s president since 2010, and the Bears have won two Big 12 championships since 2013 under Briles.In 2015, the former football player Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of sexually assaulting a Baylor soccer player. Soon after, Starr recommended the board hire outside counsel to complete an independent investigation.Subsequent reports from the ESPN show “Outside the Lines” have uncovered other accusations, including one against two players whom Baylor did not investigate for more than two years.Two years ago, the former player Tevin Elliott was convicted of sexually assaulting a Baylor freshman. Last month, the former defensive end Shawn Oakman was arrested on a sexual assault charge, and a police report surfaced detailing a 2013 domestic assault accusation against him. A reporter at a site published by Rivals.com reported that the university knew of the allegation.Advertisement
