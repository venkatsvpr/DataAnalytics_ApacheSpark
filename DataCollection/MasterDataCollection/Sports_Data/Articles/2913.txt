OKLAHOMA CITY — Blowouts have not been uncommon in these N.B.A. playoffs. But when a record-setting 73-victory team loses in the way the Golden State Warriors did Sunday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena, it must be asked if the Oklahoma City Thunder’s 133-105 trouncing of the defending champions in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals might psychologically be worth more than one win.At the very least, the Warriors know how the San Antonio Spurs felt by the conclusion of their second-round series, sensing that a transformative fulfillment of potential at the season’s most propitious stage has seized hold of the Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook-led Thunder.The Warriors faced a two-games-to-one deficit last season in the second round against Memphis and again in the finals against Cleveland. But the Thunder appear to be growing as they go. With Sunday night’s all-out assault, they set up a pivotal Game 4 on Tuesday night; another home-court victory would put the Warriors on the brink of elimination.Durant and Westbrook were dominant, scoring 33 and 30 points, with Westbrook adding 12 assists and 8 rebounds.AdvertisementStephen Curry led the Warriors with 24 points and Klay Thompson added 18, but Curry’s plus-minus was minus-39, Thompson’s was minus-41 and Draymond Green’s minus-43.Advertisement“We got what we deserved,” said Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, lamenting his team’s impatience on offense.“Bad shots, quick shots — that’s death here,” he said.In the flow of a high-profile playoff series, there always seems to be one player caught in the night’s cross fire, having to answer for the previous game, under pressure to make amends.Sunday, that was Durant, coming off a 29-point Game 2 performance, but one in which he took only five second-half shots and finished with an untidy eight turnovers.The Warriors were increasingly determined to apply as much defensive heat on him and Westbrook as possible, to force the ball out of their hands. Thunder Coach Billy Donovan said he “tried some different things” in the pick-and-roll game, resulting in better court spacing.In the aftermath of Game 2, Durant did not need anything explained for him as he is known to be especially hard on himself. But on the whole, the Thunder shot out of the gate as if jet-propelled, nurtured by a home crowd as raucous as the Warriors’ fans at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif.A more decisive Durant set the tone, not holding onto the ball when confronted by a crowd of defenders but taking every opportunity to make a strong offensive move before the Warriors could attack him.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Trailing by 42-40, they even had an opportunity to take the lead, but Thompson misfired on an open 3 from the left corner.Having pushed the boulder up the hill, the Warriors were flattened as it rolled back over them.The rest of the quarter was a stunning display by the Thunder, with the lopsidedness aggravated by the Warriors’ losing their composure.Exhibit A was that Green picked up a flagrant-1 foul — while hacked in the act of shooting — with 5 minutes 57 seconds left in the half by flailing a leg between those of Steven Adams, who wound up doubled over.Kerr argued that the contact was incidental and later said he thought the league would rescind the call, as opposed to raising it to a level-2 flagrant or possibly issuing a suspension.Alongisde Durant in the postgame interview room, Westbrook pointed out that Green, a demonstratively emotional player, had kneed Adams in the groin in Game 2.“You can’t keep kicking people in their private parts,” Westbrook said.The play further ignited the Thunder, who immediately went on a 25-4 run to finish the half, in what looked, from the opposing point of view, hauntingly familiar to what befell the Spurs over the first three quarters here in Game 6 of the conference semifinals.After consecutive baskets by Dion Waiters, Andre Iguodala fouled Durant behind the 3-point line. Durant made all three free throws and soon after threw down a vicious slam off a Westbrook penetration. He then hit a pullup 3 after blocking Green’s layup while the Warriors continued misfiring.To cap off the Golden State calamity, Green fouled Westbrook from 30 feet out as Westbrook rose for a jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the half. He made all three free throws to give him 16 points to go with his 7 assists and 6 rebounds.AdvertisementDurant’s first-half numbers underscored his renewed sense of unbridled aggression: 23 points on 6-for-10 shooting, 10 made free throws in as many attempts (or six more attempts than the Warriors), 6 rebounds and 1 turnover.“We were able to catch the ball, drive, kick it out, get our bodies moving,” Durant said, unwilling to make the night about himself.Explosive as the Warriors can be, the game felt over by halftime with the Thunder leading by 72-47. The night only deteriorated for the Warriors from there. They have until Tuesday night to convince themselves, as Kerr said, that losing by “1 point or 30,” it’s all the same.Even if the Thunder continue to press their case as a team that is all about change.A version of this article appears in print on May 23, 2016, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Spry Thunder  Deliver a Blow That Resonates.
