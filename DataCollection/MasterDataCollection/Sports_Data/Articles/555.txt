Follow our live coverage of the N.F.L. draft here.The winner of the Super Bowl in 2018, 2020 or even 2027 could be determined by the decisions of a bunch of executives in Philadelphia on Thursday night.

ESPN or NFL Network. Or watch both and don’t miss a thing. Both networks are also streaming the draft online.After 37 years, Chris Berman will no longer be ESPN’s primary host; Trey Wingo takes over.Where does it take place? For the first time since 1961, the draft will be held in Philadelphia, in a purpose-built temporary theater by the steps of the Art Museum. A sprawling fan festival will extend down Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Major street closures for the draft will virtually shut down big chunks of the city for a week. The draft coincides with the Penn Relays, another huge local event.AdvertisementThe draft was held in Philadelphia 14 times from 1936 to 1961 at more staid sites like the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel and the blue-blooded Racquet Club.AdvertisementExpect Philadelphia’s famously frenzied fans to react to their team’s first-round pick with sensible detachment.Who’s the No. 1 pick?Myles Garrett, a defensive end from Texas A&M, is expected to be taken by the Cleveland Browns with the top pick. Most scouts see him as a can’t-miss prospect. There are some naysayers, however, including the Hall of Fame defensive lineman Warren Sapp. “I see a lazy kid that makes four plays a game,” he told ESPN. “This is the No. 1 guy? No, no, no. This ain’t even close.”Who else will be selected high?There is no consensus on the No. 2 pick, held by the San Francisco 49ers, but among the many candidates are Stanford defensive end Solomon Thomas, Ohio State cornerback Marshon Lattimore and Louisiana State running back Leonard Fournette.
                The scouting of football players has given rise to a new language. It's barely intelligible.

The Southeastern Conference, of course. The conference could supply up to half of the players in the first round, with four or five from Alabama among them.Who has the most first-round picks? The Browns, the New Orleans Saints and the Tennessee Titans each have two first-rounders, with the Browns at pick 1 and 12 sitting in the best spot. After a 1-15 season, they could certainly use the help.AdvertisementWho won’t be picking for a while? As it stands now, the New England Patriots will be the last team to get to the podium, picking for the first time at No. 72 in the third round. After winning the Super Bowl two of the last three seasons, they don’t really need the help.How long am I going to have to listen to talking heads and commercials while I wait for the picks? In the first round, teams have 10 minutes for each pick. That goes down to seven minutes in Round 2, five minutes in Rounds 3 to 6, and four minutes in Round 7.How big a deal is this?
