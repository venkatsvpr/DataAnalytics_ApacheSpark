The fourth-place Preakness finisher Stradivari drew Post 5 and was installed as the second choice at 5 to 1 by the New York Racing Association oddsmaker Eric Donovan. The sixth-place Derby finisher Destin, who will break from the No. 2 hole, was the third choice at 6 to 1.In the Preakness, on May 21, Exaggerator finally reached the winner’s circle after having lost all four of his previous meetings against Nyquist, including the second-place finish in the Derby.On the morning after the Preakness, the connections of the previously undefeated Nyquist decided to engage Exaggerator in a rematch in the Belmont, but a day later, the colt was found to have a high temperature and an elevated white-blood-cell count. He was then withdrawn from consideration for the race.“It’s a little different than usually us coming through the back door, but I’ve always said I’d much rather have the favorite than be 20 to 1,” Exaggerator’s jockey, Kent Desormeaux, said Wednesday from Rockefeller Center, where, perhaps fittingly, the draw was held on a rainy afternoon. (Saturday’s forecast for Elmont, N.Y., is for temperatures in the mid-70s and partly cloudy skies.)A year after American Pharoah thrilled rugged horsemen and casual fans alike by winning the Belmont by five and a half lengths to become the 12th Triple Crown champion and the first in 37 years, this Belmont lacks considerable buzz. So far, the most talked-about news occurred off the track, when Desormeaux, 46, announced through his agent that he had entered an alcohol rehabilitation program in Utah. Desormeaux has a history of alcohol-related troubles, including a $2,500 fine from stewards at Del Mar for riding while impaired last summer.He was at Belmont Park on Tuesday to ride Exaggerator, who is trained by his brother Keith, during his final breeze. He did not address questions about rehab, saying only, “I think that my brother, mostly my wife and my family have supported me through all the years, and it was my turn to say thank you.”He added on Wednesday: “I’m truly very excited for Exaggerator, more thrilled that I’m here with my brother Keith. I just hope the story continues and we write another chapter.”Exaggerator, who had previously won two graded stakes on wet tracks, including the Grade I Santa Anita Derby on April 9, benefited from a sloppy track in the Preakness, and from Nyquist’s having to duel Uncle Lino in the fastest opening quarter-mile in Preakness history, at 22.38 seconds.In addition to Exaggerator, Stradivari and Destin, the entrants for the Belmont are Cherry Wine (second in the Preakness) and his stablemate Brody’s Cause (seventh in the Derby); Lani (fifth in the Preakness and ninth in the Derby); Suddenbreakingnews (fifth in the Derby); Creator (13th in the Derby); Trojan Nation (16th in the Derby); and the newcomers Gettysburg, Forever d’Oro, Governor Malibu and Seeking the Soul.“I think it is a wide-open field, and I think Exaggerator is a deserving favorite,” said the two-time Belmont-winning trainer Todd Pletcher, who will saddle Stradivari and Destin. “He ran great in the Derby, and he ran great in the Preakness. He’s shown up every time.”Advertisement
