The dramatic climax of Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals on Thursday night came when Stephen Curry picked up his sixth foul, hurled his mouthpiece in protest and was ejected.It was the first time Curry had fouled out of a playoff game, but his 10th time over all.Curry reached six fouls four times in his rookie year, a time when players are often said not to get the benefit of the doubt from referees. He had not fouled out of a game since 2013, before his first season as the league’s most valuable player.The N.B.A. folk wisdom is that the better the player, the more referees supposedly favor him with calls. Coach Steve Kerr alluded to that perceived pecking order after the loss: “Three of the six fouls were incredibly inappropriate calls for anybody, much less the M.V.P. of the league,” he said.After the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors to force a decisive Game 7 of the N.B.A. finals, LeBron James, Tyronn Lue, Stephen Curry and Steve Kerr discussed game and some of its controversial moments.The finals’ other superstar, LeBron James, has picked up six fouls only six times, despite having played many more years and at a more foul-prone position than Curry. In his career, James has 1.7 fouls per 36 minutes, Curry 2.6.AdvertisementJames fouled out twice in the playoffs when he was with Miami, once in 2012 and once in 2013. Both games were losses.The foul statistics at Basketball-Reference.com go back to 1983-84. In that time, the leader, including playoffs, is Shawn Kemp with 123 foul-outs, well ahead of second-place Otis Thorpe’s 89.AdvertisementThe playoff leaders are all big men: Kenyon Martin with 15, followed by Vlade Divac, Bill Laimbeer and Rik Smits.A version of this article appears in print on June 18, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Foul-Out Is First for Curry Since 2013.
