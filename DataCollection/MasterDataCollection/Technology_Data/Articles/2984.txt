Q. I am trying to figure out how to download my iTunes music library from iCloud to my iPad Pro. It appears there is no mass download feature, and I have been able to download only one song at a time. Is there a way to download all my music more efficiently? A. The iPad does have the ability to download more than one song at a time from your cloud-based list of previously purchased iTunes music, but the controls for doing so are easy to overlook.To get started, make sure you are logged into the same iTunes account on the iPad as the one you used to buy the music. Next, open the iTunes Store app on the iPad. In the row of icons along the bottom of the screen, tap Purchased on the right side. The content you have previously purchased appears in a list on the screen. Tap the “Not on This iPad” tab at the top to filter the list down to tracks you have not already downloaded to your tablet. On the right side of the screen next to “Sort,” tap the list view you want to see: “Songs by Most Recent,” “Songs by Name,” “Albums by Most Recent” or “Albums by Name.”At the top of the listed tracks, tucked on the far-left side is a “Download All Songs” or “Download All Albums” label. To download all the content, tap the cloud-download icon on the opposite side of the screen. By adjusting the Sort view to one of the album groupings, you can also download batches of songs by the album when you tap the download icon next to an album name.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
