They arrive in rectangular bubbles with rounded edges.Both Facebook and Twitter included softer and rounder elements in redesigns this year.Just last week, many Facebook users began to see comment threads appear in bubbles on their desktops.A Facebook spokesman called it “a more conversational way to comment on posts.”We spoke to some design experts about the bubbles’ ubiquity.Debbie Millman, the host of the popular podcast “Design Matters,” said the bubbles resembled the word balloons found in comic strips.AdvertisementIn comics, the balloons are usually round.Jagged ones tend to mean a character is frazzled, angry or otherwise upset.AdvertisementScott McCloud, the author of “Understanding Comics,” called the bubbles the graphic equivalent of quotation marks.He said that the comics pioneer Will Eisner had called word balloons a “desperation device.”Mr. Eisner was referring to the struggle to represent sound in a soundless medium.Mr. McCloud added that bubbles created a consistent amount of negative space around words, which was desirable from a graphic standpoint.The rounded edges of text bubbles also gave messages a soft, friendly connotation.That’s an element especially useful in texted communication, where tone and body language are absent.Mr. McCloud said that hard edges and right angles conveyed an unintended sharpness.Ambiguity, especially in text messages and online, tends to be perceived negatively.Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
