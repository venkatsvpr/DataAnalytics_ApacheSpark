It was also an important component of Android, and Google argues that it didn’t need to pay Sun to use it since Java was governed by an open-source license.Not so fast, Oracle has been arguing since 2010. For the second time, a jury has sided with Google. But the fight isn’t over: Oracle says it will appeal.Advertisement
