The Golden State Warriors have become Silicon Valley’s home team.As the Warriors enter Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, techie fever for the team — which counts Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif., across San Francisco Bay from Silicon Valley, as its home court — has gripped much of the digerati. Seated courtside at many home games has been a coterie of big industry names, including the Apple executive Eddy Cue and the venture capitalist Ben Horowitz.The Warriors have become a proxy for the tech industry in other ways, writes Farhad Manjoo. With the fandom from tech executives and their usually fat wallets for the Warriors, ticket prices for the team have soared, increasingly seeming out of reach for ordinary people. The situation is akin to the San Francisco Bay Area’s housing situation — too many techies flocking in have pushed up rental and home prices beyond what many regular people can afford, writes Mr. Manjoo.Mr. Manjoo looks at a different slice of tech with his story in this week’s Bits special section on digital culture. Although much of online culture has become toxic, there are benefits, too, he writes. Namely, he points to how Facebook has become a tool for visibility and empathy, helping to shift thinking on issues such as transgender equality.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
