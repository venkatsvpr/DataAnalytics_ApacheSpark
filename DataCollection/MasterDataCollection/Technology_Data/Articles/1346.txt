But on Thursday, the American search giant tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers’ choices and hamstrung its competitors.The back-and-forth between Google and Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official, highlights the increasing stakes in three competition cases against the search giant, the earliest of which dates to 2010. The standoff is likely to define Europe’s often weary relationship with American technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook for years to come.Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The rebuttals relate to years-old accusations that Google unfairly diverted traffic from competitors to favor its own comparison-shopping site, and that the company abused its dominant market position when offering some search products on other companies’ websites.“We can’t agree with a case that lacks evidence and would limit our ability to serve our users,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, wrote in a blog post on Thursday.“We’re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts,” he wrote, adding that Google’s products “benefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition.”In the third case, Google has until Nov. 11 to respond to European Union charges that it used Android, its popular mobile operating system, to promote its own services — like mobile search — over those of its rivals. The company denies any wrongdoing.Google worries that Europe’s antitrust efforts may eventually hurt its lucrative business model, particularly if it is forced to open up some of its dominant digital services to rivals.For the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, the standoff with Google has become a litmus test for its ability to rein in a dominant technology company, one that has a roughly 90 percent market share in online search in the region. A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on Google’s antitrust response.The end to the back and forth will not come overnight. The European authorities must now review Google’s rebuttals, and decisions in the cases are not expected until early next summer. The company can then appeal, prolonging the legal wrangling.But for Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, an online marketplace for Android smartphone apps, who has filed a complaint against Google, the antitrust cases are necessary to give European companies the space to compete against their much larger American rival.“Our growth is being slowed down because of Google’s dominant position,” he said. “We know what’s at stake. There needs to be innovation in the European market.”Follow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.Advertisement
