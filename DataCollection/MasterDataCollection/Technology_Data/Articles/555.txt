Today, many organizations, celebrities and politicians, including President Trump, view it as a crucial tool for reaching their audiences.The service has also shrunk the distance between the anonymous and the famous, the frivolous and the serious.The most-liked tweet of 2017 was a quotation about unity posted by former President Obama in the wake of the white supremacist violence this summer in Charlottesville, Va. And the most retweeted message was a plea from a teenager on a quest for a year’s worth of free chicken nuggets. Make of that what you will.The library’s decision, the result of a continuing evaluation of its practices, was driven by a number of factors, from the difficulty of maintaining the collection to the waning need for a comprehensive archive, the library said.Now that it has nearly 12 years’ worth of tweets in the collection, the library suggested that it had largely fulfilled its original goal of documenting the rise and evolution of Twitter.“With social media now established, the Library is bringing its collecting practice more in line with its collection policies,” it said in the document.The move was also driven by practical concerns, including both the difficulty in archiving the huge amount of data on Twitter and the fact that the library has only ever collected the text of tweets even as they have become increasingly visual.Twitter has also grown exponentially in the years since the library started its collection. That year, 2010, about half a billion tweets were posted every two weeks. In November, that many were sent each day. The messages are now longer: The company recently doubled its limit for tweets to 280 from 140 characters.Such complications have plagued public access to the archive, too, which is limited while the library works to find a cost-effective and sustainable way to open the archive to the public.Advertisement
