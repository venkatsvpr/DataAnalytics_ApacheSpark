They must have figured — wrongly — that at some point all those computers would be replaced. Certainly, long before the end of the century, when the machines would have a hard time telling the difference between 1900 and 2000.To those of us allergic to repetitive tasks, it makes sense that Peter spends the movie trying not to work anymore. But in the late 1990s, companies around the world probably had tens of thousands of workers doing what Peter did — although it’s hard to say if the job was as boring as he claimed. Hundreds of billions of dollars were spent addressing the problem.And guess what? As Farhad Manjoo writes, it worked. Major computer problems were avoided, and even though skeptics still think the whole thing was overblown, the biggest reason for that success is most likely the urgency paid to Y2K.Farhad has an intriguing thought: The fight against climate change has a thing or two to learn from the Y2K effort. Both were nebulous threats, somewhere off in the distance. Both faced plenty of skeptics. But people got serious about Y2K and headed off a tech disaster — even if you still think it was all a bunch of baloney.Advertisement
