The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack declined to comment. The funding talks were earlier reported by Recode, and Amazon’s interest was reported by Bloomberg.Slack’s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October. For about 1.5 million of those, Slack is paid $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, but most customers use a free version. The company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s chief executive, has said publicly that he wants to build a giant company and that he has therefore been opportunistic about amassing a war chest of capital.The funding that Slack has amassed may come in handy as it faces competition from Microsoft, which recently introduced a rival product called Teams that is bundled for free with Office 365, which has 85 million users. Facebook also has a work collaboration tool, Workplace, which is free to many users, and Atlassian, a smaller company, is also a competitor.Slack is trying to sign on more large companies as customers. It recently expanded its sales and marketing teams. Last fall, it brought in a seasoned sales executive, Kevin Egan, who had most recently worked at Dropbox. This year, it hired Terry Anderson, a former Intel executive, to lead its global public-relations team.Michael de la Merced contributed reporting from London, and Nick Wingfield from New York.Follow Katie Benner on Twitter @ktbenner.Advertisement
