Some items might be overstocked, while others have aesthetic flaws or are nearing expiration. By noon, the chef Lucas Jeffries and his staff have pulled together a three-course menu that is posted several hours later on a chalkboard.On our visit, an enthusiastic server told us how the restaurant was started as a pop-up in 2014 by four workers at the Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn, an attempt to combat the food waste they witnessed. With support from the grocer, it became a restaurant last year, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in a cheery setting.We started with delicious day-old brown bread, olive oil (one of the few items Instock buys, along with dairy) and a plate of perfectly pickled beets. The rotating wine list comes from discontinued lines or bottles with damaged labels, while beer made with bread is bought from a Belgian brewery.Our soup combined a sweet-and-sour orange base with add-ons of raw radish and brussels sprouts leaves, and a topping of the best onion rings I’ve tasted — small, crisp and not greasy.My friend Erik and my wife, Selina, ordered the meatloaf, served with white beans in a roasted pepper sauce, and chunky potato chips, roasted broccoli and pickled cucumber. Erik thought the loaf was brick-like, and I agreed, but Selina loved it. My veggie version swapped meat for cheese-covered leeks, which were soft and flavorful, but rendered the beans a less-appealing companion.We all raved over dessert — baked apple with a rich caramel sauce served with ice cream topped with a cinnamon crumble.The next day I spoke with Freke van Nimwegen, one of the founders, apologizing for our mixed reactions, but saying we’d love to revisit (or at least two of us would).“Of course I’m disappointed, but every day is different, and we do have a lot of regulars,” she said. “We’re really happy to take food waste mainstream. If everyone has knowledge, they’ll waste less.”So what does Instock do with its leftovers? It either goes to make biogas, is used in staff meals or is donated.Instock, Czaar Peterstraat 21; 31-20-363-5765; instock.nl/en. Three-course dinner for two, including service, 45 euros (about $50).Advertisement
