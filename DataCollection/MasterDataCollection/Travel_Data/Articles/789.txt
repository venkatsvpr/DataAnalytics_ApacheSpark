But ultimately, it was when an airport employee punched a man who was holding a baby in the face that caused an uproar. EasyJet apologized and said the gate agent was not an airline employee. “We are concerned to see this — it is not an easyJet staff member & they do not work for our ground handling agents,” the airline said on Twitter.It’s been a tough year for airline PR departments.
