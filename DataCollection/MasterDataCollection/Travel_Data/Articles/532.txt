The nonprofit concept is meant to attract artists, musicians and actors visiting and working in London. The hotel also has partnerships with local cultural institutions including Somerset House and the Royal Court theater to house their visiting artists. But the developers say some rooms, which include 22 doubles, two studio apartments and two dormitory rooms, one that sleeps 12 and the other 16, will always be available to the public. Lodged in a 1935-vintage power company building, Green Rooms is in North London across from the Wood Green Underground station, about a 20-minute ride from the West End. Rates start at £18 (about $26) a night.ELAINE GLUSACTravelers to Yosemite National Park in California have new accommodations to consider booking with the June 15 opening of Rush Creek Lodge, which claims to be the first resort to open in the Yosemite region in more than 25 years.
