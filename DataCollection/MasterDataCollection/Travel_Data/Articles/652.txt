In the never-ending battle to get passengers to pay attention to flight safety rules, airlines have increasingly attempted to bring humor, creativity and style to their in-flight videos.The latest comes from British Airways, who on Tuesday released a six-minute short featuring some of the country’s best-known actors and comedians, including Ian McKellen, Gordon Ramsay, Thandie Newton and Rowan Atkinson — all being “directed” in screen tests by the actor and writer Asim Chaudhry.“It’s extremely important to us that customers engage with our safety video, and involving some of the nation’s most well-known personalities has given us the chance to create something fun that we hope people will watch from start to finish — and remember,” Alex Cruz, the chief executive of British Airways, said in a statement.The new video, which will begin airing on flights in September, is also designed to raise money for Flying Start, a charity partnership between the airline and Comic Relief.How does it stack up with some of the more impressive offerings from other airlines in recent years? Here are five that set the bar high.AdvertisementThis is just one of the many memorable flight safety videos the airline puts out on a regular basis, including Betty White teaching safety “old school” at a Palm Springs retirement home and Richard Simmons sweating to the oldies at 10,000 feet. Here, Elijah Wood, Peter Jackson and others from the “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” movie trilogies help passengers travel safely to Middle-earth.AdvertisementAn all-out dance party, directed, appropriately, by Jon M. Chu, known for movies like “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never.” The video inspired at least one flight attendant to show off his own dance moves.Zach King is a web personality who gained notoriety a few years ago with his Vines, in which he edits his videos to make it look like he’s doing magic and creating illusions. Turkish Airlines adapted his approach for this safety video.Of course it’s French: You won’t find a more chic and stylish flight safety video. For some, it’s a little too cute, but it gained a lot of attention after its release for a reason.Set design and choreography are what make this one from American stand out, particularly in its opening section (if only there was this much space on a real airplane). It’s full of little surprises throughout, like arm rests that turn into human arms and hands, and the synchronized movements and beat makes for a pleasingly hypnotic viewing experience.Follow Justin Sablich on Twitter: @JustinSablichWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
