A portion of the proceeds will go to two national anti-bullying organizations in a nod to the films of the director John Hughes, which shared a backdrop of teen bullying and high school issues, Mr. Blanchard said.“ ‘Ferris Bueller’ is timeless,” he said. “It’s really about breaking free from that 9 to 5 grind and really appreciating life and taking an adventure, whatever that might be.”The Hughes family has endorsed the event, Mr. Blanchard said, and family members, along with some of the cast — among them Cindy Pickett (who played Katie Bueller), Lyman Ward (Tom Bueller), Edie McClurg (Grace) and Jonathan Schmock (the maître d’ of Chez Quiz) — will attend two screenings ($25) at the Gorton Community Center in Lake Forest, Ill. Other events include an opening night ’80s high-school-theme dance party with cast meet-and-greets ($50) in Mr. Hughes’s hometown, Northbrook, Ill., including a chance to be photographed with a replica of the Ferrari Spyder from the film, along with Larry “Flash” Jenkins, who played its errant garage attendant ($100). Two days of filming location bus tours (from $175) cap the event.Hotels in Chicago are also rallying around the film’s anniversary. The Virgin Hotel will have a replica of the Bueller bedroom (admission, $10), re-created by the artist Sarah Keenlyside, where visitors can step into Ferris’s elaborately staged sick day as it looked on screen. Tickets include an invitation to a “Twist and Shout” parade through downtown Chicago.The Hotel Lincoln’s “Save Ferris” package (from $350) comes with tickets to the Cubs, the Art Institute of Chicago, Willis Tower and Skydeck — all “Day Off” destinations — along with a Blu-ray copy of the movie.The Palmer House’s “Bueller’s Chicago” package (from $258) includes movie-inspired amenities, among them a Spotify playlist of tunes from the film; a “bucket list” of locations to help guests re-create Ferris’s day off in Chicago; tickets to the Art Institute of Chicago; and a reservation at the hotel’s Lockwood Restaurant for dinner under the name Abe Froman — the “sausage king of Chicago.”Advertisement
