Theme parks in Orlando like Disney’s Magic Kingdom Park and Epcot, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando are being more vigilant following the shooting in the city early Sunday morning at Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead.In an email, a spokeswoman for Disney, Jacquee Wahler, wrote, “Unfortunately, we’ve all been living in a world of uncertainty, and during this time we have increased our security measures across our properties, adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers [metal detectors], additional canine units, and law enforcement officers on site, as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.”Few of the representatives for the other parks were willing to comment on any specific security measures being implemented following the catastrophe over the weekend, but a handful did say that they were being more vigilant.In an email, a SeaWorld spokeswoman, Suzanne Pelisson Beasley, said: “The safety of our ambassadors, guests and animals has always been our top priority. Our security teams work closely with law enforcement and we have enhanced security measures at all our parks.”AdvertisementAlso, a Universal Orlando spokesman, Tom Schroder, said that guest safety is the park’s top priority, but that the company doesn’t discuss security plans and procedures.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In the last week of January, occupancy rates in the city were up 18 percent over 2015. Also, 66.1 million people visited Orlando in 2015, making it the most visited destination in the United States.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
