Stocks closed modestly higher on Friday, ending three days of losses, after the U.S. government’s disappointing jobs report added to speculation that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates low for another year.Investors were also weighing tepid U.S. earnings reports and persistent weakness in the global economy.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 6.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,057.14, and the Nasdaq composite rose 19.06 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,736.16.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,740.63.The three major indexes ended the week slightly lower, despite Friday’s gains.AdvertisementStocks started the day lower after the Labor Department said U.S. employers had created just 160,000 jobs last month, significantly below the 200,000 that economists were expecting.AdvertisementWhile one month does not make a trend, there have been a few reports this week from around the world that suggested weakness in the global economy. A closely watched Chinese manufacturing survey showed production contracted last month, and European Union officials trimmed their forecasts for growth across the 19 countries that use the euro.“Once again, we received evidence that the U.S. economy is just bumbling along and will most likely remain so until after the U.S. presidential election,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director of fixed income at Seaport Global.Stocks turned higher in the early afternoon and stayed there, reflecting that, in a way, the bad news of the jobs report was good news for investors, who have benefited from more than seven years of extremely low interest rates.Mr. Di Galoma and others said that the April jobs report significantly reduced the possibility that the Federal Reserve would interest rates in June or even later this year. “In my view, a rate hike potential this year is nearing zero probability,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
