LONDON — Groupe Fnac said on Monday that it had increased its stake in its takeover target Darty and made a final, sweetened offer as a bidding war continued for the French electronics and appliance retailer.Fnac and Conforama, the French household goods retail unit of Steinhoff International Holdings, have been entwined in frantic battle for Darty, with each offering a series of escalating bids last week. Throughout the course of the day on Monday, Fnac made several announcements that it had increased its holdings of Darty.In its latest announcement, Fnac said that it owned 18.93 percent of Darty’s shares and was now willing to pay 914 million pounds, or about $1.3 billion, in cash for the retailer, or 170 pence per share. Fnac said that it owned or had agreements in place for investors to support its offer, equivalent to 41.05 percent of Darty’s shares.The offer, which included an option for Darty investors to accept Fnac shares instead of cash, trumped Conforama’s prior highest bid of 160 pence a share, or about £860 million, in cash.Advertisement“Conforama is currently considering its options and urges Darty shareholders to take no further action at this time,” the company said in a news release on Monday.AdvertisementThe final offer by Fnac came just days after Conforama said that a Steinhoff unit, Steinhoff Finance Holdings, had acquired a further 4.81 million shares of Darty and owned about 20.4 percent of the retailer.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
