Some German investors have also called for the companies to re-evaluate their plans in light of the vote, and to move the holding company’s base elsewhere in the European Union.Investors in the German exchange have until July 12 to accept an offer to exchange their Deutsche Börse stock for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity, which the companies have said would have headquarters in both London and Frankfurt and be based in Britain. At least 75 percent of Deutsche Börse’s outstanding shares must be tendered in the offer for the deal to be successful.“I strongly endorse the statement of London Stock Exchange Group following their general meeting today and continue to recommend the transaction to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse,” Joachim Faber, the Deutsche Börse chairman, said in a news release.On Monday, shareholders representing 99.89 percent of the London Stock Exchange Group’s outstanding shares voted in favor of the deal.The exchanges’ boards have formed a referendum committee to make recommendations to the board of the combined group “in order to meet all regulatory requirements to secure closing of the transaction and achieve its commercial objectives.”The committee’s work may take “many months,” the companies said.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
