LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it remained committed to selling a stake in the Lloyds Banking Group to retail investors, and to exiting its holdings in the lender by next year.Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government, which has a 9.2 percent stake in the bank, would offer some of its holdings to retail investors this year.The government took a stake in the lender after it provided a bailout of 17 billion pounds, or $24 billion at current exchange rates, to Lloyds during the financial crisis.On Tuesday, Lloyds paid a dividend of £130 million to the government, bringing the total the government has recovered to more than £16.8 billion.AdvertisementThe government delayed a sale to retail investors in January because of turmoil in the financial markets, the second delay since 2014.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
