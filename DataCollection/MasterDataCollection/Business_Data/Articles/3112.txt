That deal came together after Baker Hughes’s planned merger with another oil field services company, Halliburton, collapsed after the United States Justice Department sued to block the combination.Suez would acquire 70 percent of the water business, while the remaining 30 percent would be owned by the Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, the companies said on Wednesday.The transaction valued the business at 3.2 billion euros, or about $3.4 billion.The deal would bolster Suez’s geographic reach, particularly in the United States and in emerging markets, the French company said.“Clients will benefit from the combined knowledge, expertise, geographic footprint and leading edge products and services available,” Jean-Louis Chaussade, the Suez chief executive, said in a news release. “The transaction will also deliver strong value to our shareholders by enhancing Suez’s profitable growth profile.”The G.E. business provides water treatment and process services to industrial clients and reported revenue of $2.1 billion last year, with about half of that in North America. It has operations in 130 countries and has more than 7,500 employees.The transaction is expected to close in mid-2017 and is subject to regulatory approval.Suez, based in Paris, provides water treatment and waste services on five continents. It has more than 82,000 employees and reported revenue of €15.3 billion in 2016.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
