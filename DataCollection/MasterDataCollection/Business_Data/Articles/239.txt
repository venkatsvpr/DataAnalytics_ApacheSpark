Charter Communications said on Thursday that its proposals to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks had been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, overcoming the last hurdle to complete the deals.The Federal Communications Commission confirmed last week that it approved the deals that would turn Charter, based in Stamford, Conn., into the second-largest American broadband provider and third-largest video provider.The Justice Department gave antitrust approval, with conditions, to the acquisitions on April 25, and Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders have already agreed to the deals.In May 2015, Charter said it would buy Time Warner Cable in a cash-and-stock deal, a move it said would allow it to better compete with Comcast. Charter has valued the deals at $56.7 billion for Time Warner Cable, excluding debt, and $10.4 billion for Bright House.AdvertisementCharter shares closed down about 1.5 percent, and Time Warner Cable shares were down about half a percent.“We look forward to closing these transactions next week and to begin delivering the many benefits of these transactions to consumers,” Charter’s chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge, said in a statement.Advertisement“We’re thrilled that the transaction has cleared the final regulatory hurdle, and we look forward to closing the deal quickly,” Time Warner Cable’s chief executive, Robert D. Marcus, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on May 13, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Last Hurdle For Charter Is Cleared In California.
