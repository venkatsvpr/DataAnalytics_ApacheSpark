With no other options, Energy Transfer Equity needs to run down the clock.If the pipeline company can delay filing all the documents it needs to complete its merger with the Williams Companies, it might not have to close the deal and pay a chunk of cash to shareholders.Efforts by company insiders, including the chief executive Kelcy Warren, to cancel the deal are well known, but a new lawsuit in the six-month-old dispute reveals new details about the battle among prestigious Wall Street law firms.The lawsuit was filed by the Williams Companies in Delaware Chancery Court just six weeks before the June 28 deadline after which Energy Transfer, which is based in Dallas, can walk away. It asks the court to stop Energy Transfer from trying to break up the deal.A focus on the latest lawsuit — the third Williams has filed since March — was the role of the lawyers on either side: Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which served as counsel for Williams, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which served as Energy Transfer’s primary lawyers.AdvertisementThe former lodged complaints about delay tactics, saying the latter remained “conspicuously quiet” and “noticeably silent” over issues that have threatened to scuttle the deal. And then there was Latham & Watkins, another firm representing Energy Transfer. The lawsuit heaps much of the blame on its failure to come up with a tax opinion needed for the deal to close.AdvertisementWilliams said last week, after filing the lawsuit, that Energy Transfer “has breached the merger agreement through a pattern of delay and obstruction.”Mr. Warren of Energy Transfer responded that by filing three lawsuits in six weeks, Williams had “contributed materially to the very delay in completing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s review.” He said that Energy Transfer had shown good faith by agreeing to give both parties an extra month to finish their proxy statement.“We believe Williams’s latest lawsuit is an attempt to gain undue leverage in and undermine future discussions regarding the pending merger and will only result in future delay,” Mr. Warren said.The contentiousness between typically buttoned-up lawyers reflects the hostility that has festered between their clients practically from the beginning. Initially, Williams was reluctant to agree to an all-stock merger with Energy Transfer, so Energy Transfer threw in $6 billion in cash to sweeten the deal. A divided board eventually voted with a majority in favor, and the deal was signed last September.Then the buyer’s remorse set in. The stock prices of both companies declined precipitously as the energy markets collapsed last fall, making the cash portion of the transaction ever more essential to Williams shareholders, and ever more burdensome to Energy Transfer. But the merger agreement they signed had given Energy Transfer no easy way out.So in mid-January, Energy Transfer asked Williams to restructure the transaction to all stock or terminate the deal altogether, the lawsuit says. Williams rejected the proposal, saying publicly that it remained committed to the deal.
                If Energy Transfer Equity can delay filing documents to complete its merger with the Williams Companies, it might not have to close the deal and pay a chunk of cash to shareholders.            From then on, Energy Transfer “settled on a plan to try to avoid their obligations under the merger agreement by illegitimate means,” the lawsuit says.AdvertisementThe minor grievances detailed in the lawsuit included a printer problem that held up a document for nine hours. Another addition to that document took eight more days to complete, though it was just several paragraphs long. There were other missed deadlines, here and there.But then, it became more complicated. Over an 11-day period in April, Energy Transfer lowered its financial projections for the deal four times, even as the energy market stabilized. The S.E.C. said that updating these projections was unnecessary, but Energy Transfer did it anyway, after hiring yet another law firm.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The firm’s reasoning was initially not disclosed — something the S.E.C. later requested, causing further delays. Latham had one reason for holding back, then Energy Transfer retained yet another law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, to provide a second theory.It was enough for Mr. Warren to declare seven times in a conference call with analysts this month that the sides cannot close the deal.Latham told Cravath in mid-April that it could not render an opinion because of a decline in Energy Transfer’s stock. Cravath countered that the status was based on the value of the assets at the signing of the deal, not the closing.Morgan, Lewis & Bockius was retained to assess the tax risks in the deal. This firm said that the Internal Revenue Service would not deem the deal tax-free given the nature by which they were transferring assets.In response, Williams sent Energy Transfer two proposals to fix the structure of the deal in a way that would not cause concerns over taxes, or change the value accorded to either side. Energy Transfer rejected these changes through a filing — without any explanation over email, phone or letter, the lawsuit said.Williams also said that Energy Transfer was seeking to make the deal less appealing to Williams shareholders. Jamie Welch, who was the chief financial officer at Energy Transfer until he was abruptly fired in February, had called Williams shareholders and asked them to vote against the deal, The New York Times reported in March.“By making these telephone calls, defendants actively sought to prejudice Williams’s stockholders against the proposed transaction and thereby cause it to fail,” the lawsuit said.AdvertisementEnergy Transfer also conducted a private stock placement that gave certain shareholders, including Mr. Warren, priority over others when it comes to cash distributions (similar to dividends, but for pipeline companies). In separate litigation, Williams is seeking to unwind this.Williams used this transaction as an example in the latest case, saying that it sent “the message that Williams’s stockholders will be second-class stockholders and will not receive the same distributions as E.T.E. insiders after the deal closes.”Williams’s board continues to recommend that its stockholders approve the deal with Energy Transfer.A version of this article appears in print on May 20, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Suit Claims Delays Mean to Sink Deal on Pipelines.
