The wearable fitness device maker Fitbit on Wednesday forecast profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analysts’ estimates, overshadowing a strong first-quarter report and sending the company’s shares down 13 percent in after-hours trading.Fitbit has been spending heavily to diversify its portfolio of colorful wristbands and clippable devices that track calories, sleeping patterns and heart rates, to better compete against rising rivals from Apple and Garmin, as well as to tap into new markets.“The time to invest is now,” said the company’s chief financial officer, Bill Zerella. He added that Fitbit would need to increase spending in China and India as it builds a “global brand.”Fitbit’s operating costs nearly tripled to $215 million in the first quarter, which ended April 2, largely because of marketing for the $200 Blaze smartwatch and the Alta wristband, the company’s first global releases.AdvertisementFitbit forecast an adjusted profit of 8 to 11 cents a share for the second quarter, widely missing analysts’ average estimate of 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
