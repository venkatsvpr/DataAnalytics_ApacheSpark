American safety officials have said moisture and temperature changes could make the airbag unstable and prone to explode, sending sharp fragments of metal flying through a car’s interior. The airbags have been blamed for at least 13 deaths worldwide.The new recall increases the number of vehicles affected in Japan to 19.6 million. Regulators in the United States this month  more than doubled the number of vehicles with Takata airbags to be recalled to about 63 million, adding to what was already the largest auto safety recall in American history.“Takata and automakers conducted an investigation in the case, and the ministry decided to make an announcement based on the result,” said Masato Sahashi, a Transport Ministry official who oversees enforcement of recalls.Takata declined to comment.The widened recalls are adding to questions on how the Japanese company will deal with the mounting costs of the recall. Takata said in the past week that it had tapped Lazard, an investment bank, to help it seek a cash infusion.“Obviously, Takata will have a huge liability that they have to handle,” said Takaki Nakanishi, an independent auto industry analyst.Typically an auto parts supplier like Takata shares of the cost of the recall with automakers. Takata remains a key auto industry supplier, and analysts have said that gives carmakers an incentive to help it out.“If Takata disappears, automakers will be in trouble,” Koji Endo, managing director at Advanced Research Japan, said in an interview in the past week. “Automakers are not happy with the situation, but there is a realistic option they have to pay the cost.”Takata had changed the makeup of the ammonium nitrate compound that it used to make the airbag inflater, adding a drying agent to make it more stable. This recall involved airbags that do not have this drying agent.Advertisement
