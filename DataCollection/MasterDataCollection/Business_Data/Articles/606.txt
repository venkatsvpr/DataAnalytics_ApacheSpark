At the time, 21st Century Fox and News Corporation — which owns The Sun and The Times of London — had not yet been separated.The latest deal has already attracted scrutiny.Politicians have called for the British government to review the transaction because of concerns over concentration of media power. It is already expected to come under review by European Union antitrust regulators.For sale: data from more than one billion Yahoo users, including several million military and civilian government employees from dozens of nations.The cost: about $300,000 for each copy of the database, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an online security firm.Mr. Komarov monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers, and said three buyers paid for a complete copy of the information.Yahoo’s stock plunged 6 percent on Thursday as investors worried that the disclosure of the huge security breach would put at risk the deal for it to be sold to Verizon.Mr. Komarov said his company alerted military and law enforcement authorities in several countries about the hack, but did not go to Yahoo directly because it had been dismissive of InfoArmor when it was approached by an intermediary.“I believe Ivanka is more open-minded a person you can reason with.”Russell Ybarra, the owner of a Tex-Mex restaurant chain who had bid $67,888 for coffee with Ivanka Trump in the hope that he could urge her to persuade her father, Donald J. Trump, not to go too far in restricting immigration. The auction has raised questions because of the prominent role that the president-elect’s children have in the transition process.“As January goes, so goes the entire market year.”Wrong. (This year at least.)After a bleak January for stocks, major American markets have been at or near record highs as we near the end of the year.More recently, the dollar has surged and Treasury prices have tumbled after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as The Wall Street Journal reports. This could hamper earnings, but stock markets seem to have taken it in stride.It can be tricky to predict what will happen on the stock market, especially if you’re not sure what lies ahead in a Trump administration.Burton Malkiel, emeritus professor of economics at Princeton, has some sage advice: “Whether you think Trump will be wildly successful or he’ll be a disaster, don’t try to move in or out of assets because you think you know what’s going to happen.”Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.Advertisement
