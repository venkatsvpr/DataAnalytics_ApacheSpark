SEATTLE — Amazon is introducing new options to subscribe to its Prime membership service on a monthly basis, a change that could make the company’s video service a tougher competitor to Netflix.On Sunday evening, the company notified visitors to its website that it now offers two new Prime price plans, the first of which costs customers $8.99 a month to stream movies and television shows from a new video-only version of its Prime service. A second new plan, priced at $10.99 a month, will provide access to the full benefits of the Prime service, including video streaming, free two-day shipping on Amazon orders, music streaming and other services.Amazon Prime, by most accounts, has been a huge success for the company, but one of the biggest hurdles for anyone thinking about joining the service is that it has required customers to pay $99 up front for an annual membership. The new options do away with the need for an annual commitment to Prime, widening its appeal to people who are more comfortable joining it on a short-term basis.The new monthly options will not save people money, though. Customers who subscribe month-to-month for the full Prime service will pay $32.88 more a year than if they subscribe on an annual basis, while subscribers to the video service will pay $8.88 more a year while getting substantially fewer benefits, like free two-day shipping, than annual Prime members.AdvertisementAmazon began to tinker with the pricing of its Prime service last month, when it introduced a new $10.99 monthly membership option for the full Prime service by allowing customers of Sprint to tack the Amazon service onto their monthly cellular bills.AdvertisementNow, by broadening the monthly options for Prime to anyone and introducing a video-only service, the company is making it easier for people to compare the price of Prime to that of Netflix, the dominant subscription streaming provider, with more than 75 million subscribers globally.Netflix has long been available on a monthly basis, without an annual commitment, offering several plans ranging from $7.99 to $11.99 a month, depending on video quality and the number of screens to which customers can stream video at the same time.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Piper Jaffray recently estimated there are between 57 million and 61 million Prime subscribers.The company’s decision to offer a video-only version of Prime reflects a growing confidence at the company in the quality of the service. Amazon got started in video streaming much later than Netflix, and its catalog of movies and television shows was initially anemic by comparison.For a time, Amazon’s video service seemed like little more than a nice additional benefit to the main attraction of the Prime service, two-day free shipping.But Amazon has steadily chipped away at skepticism of its seriousness in video by expanding the amount of content available for streaming.It has nabbed rights to popular series like “Downton Abbey” and “Mr. Robot,” which are not available to stream on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has poured money into producing original content, including award-winning shows like “Transparent” and “Mozart in the Jungle.”A version of this article appears in print on April 18, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Amazon Opens Prime to Monthly Subscriptions in Move to Challenge Netflix.
