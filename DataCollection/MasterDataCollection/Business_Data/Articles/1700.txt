He will continue to serve as an analyst on Fox’s pregame show for pro football.The president of ABC News, James Goldston, said in a statement: “Over the past two years on ‘G.M.A.,’ Michael’s proven to be a tireless and versatile broadcaster with an incredible ability to connect with people, from veterans and all kinds of newsmakers to a host of modern American cultural icons.”Mr. Goldston added, “He will help us drive forward into a very exciting future.”The network also said it would search for Mr. Strahan’s successor on “Live” beginning in the fall, after he departs.Advertisement
