Energy companies led a broad rally in United States stocks on Monday as investors shrugged off another slide in crude oil prices.The gain nudged the Dow Jones industrial average above the 18,000-point mark for the first time since last summer, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose to the highest level in a year.The market headed lower early on, after news that representatives from several major oil-producing nations meeting over the weekend in Doha, Qatar, had failed to reach a deal to cut output. That sent the price of United States oil down 7 percent at one point before recouping much of its losses. It ended down 1.4 percent.Beyond the volatile oil market, investors had their eye on the latest company earnings, which have been mostly encouraging so far, said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Advertisement“We’re seeing broad-based gains across all the sectors,” Mr. Lynch said. “The market is maybe finding some resilience here and maybe looking back on the fundamentals of the earnings season and seeing it’s not so bad.”AdvertisementThe Dow climbed 106.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,004.16. The last time the average was above 18,000 points was on July 20.
