RushCard, which last fall pledged to reimburse thousands of customers who could not use the money in their prepaid card accounts because of a technical problem, this week agreed to pay $19 million to settle a lawsuit with cardholders over the incident.The settlement, plus $1.5 million in lawyer’s fees, is subject to court approval. But it adds up to many times the amount of money the prepaid card provider had promised to set aside to repay customers whose checks bounced or who otherwise had to pay fees because their accounts were unusable. RushCard customers were unable to use their money, some for more than a week, after a botched computer conversion over the Columbus Day weekend in 2015.“We are pleased to have reached this preliminary settlement, which will resolve the claims of our cardholders,” Rick Savard, the chief executive of UniRush, the parent company of RushCard, said in a statement. “We believe this settlement fairly compensates our customers who were inconvenienced.”RushCard was founded in 2003 by the hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons, who has said he wanted to offer a better alternative than the high-fee prepaid products that were on the market at the time.AdvertisementThe settlement gives 300,000 people the chance to recoup $100 to $500 for any costs they incurred because of being locked out of their accounts, minus any payments RushCard might already have made to them, the lawyer for the cardholders said. “We’re very pleased with the result and the speed by which RushCard and the other defendants were able to settle this matter,” John Yanchunis, the lawyer for the cardholders, said. Metabank, which issues the cards on behalf of RushCard, and Mr. Simmons’s Rush Communications were also named in the lawsuit.AdvertisementPrepaid cards are popular with lower-income people, many of whom do not have traditional bank accounts or have been shut out of the banking system because of habitual overdrafts or poor or limited credit. Five percent of adults, about 12 million people, use prepaid cards at least once a month, according to an analysis in 2014 by the Pew Charitable Trust. Those who use them typically earn $25,000 a year or less, the study said.The technical troubles last fall occurred when RushCard, which is based in Cincinnati, converted its systems to a different processor. The problems brought a barrage of criticism to the company; customers vented their frustrations on social media because they were unable to get answers from the company. The episode prompted inquiries by lawmakers and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.RushCard said last fall that it would set up a $2 million to $3 million fund to reimburse customers for their losses and inconvenience. The company also waived fees through February. At the time, the company said the cost of the reimbursement fund and lost fee revenue would amount to what the company, which is privately held, made in profit for 2015.A version of this article appears in print on May 14, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: RushCard to Settle Prepaid Card Suit for $19 Million.
