Ferdinand Piëch, a former chief executive of Volkswagen who was a dominant presence at the carmaker for more than two decades, has agreed to sell most of his 15 percent stake in the family holding company to his relatives rather than to an outside investor. The stake was valued at more than $1 billion.The deal, announced on Monday, averts the turmoil that might have ensued if the Porsche and the Piëch families had been forced to absorb an outside shareholder into Porsche Automobil Holding, which owns 52 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares. Volkswagen also has preferred shares that entitle their owners to dividends but do not include voting rights.But critics of the way the family has overseen Volkswagen may see the deal as a missed opportunity to bring in new viewpoints and shake up the carmaker’s insular company culture. The indirect stake in Volkswagen would have been attractive to Chinese investors, among others.“The transfer underlines the commitment of the Porsche and Piëch families as co-owners of Porsche Automobil Holding SE and Volkswagen,” the holding company said in a statement.AdvertisementMr. Piëch, who will turn 80 on April 17, is regarded as an automotive genius who oversaw Volkswagen’s rise to become the largest carmaker in Europe by far.AdvertisementAt the same time, Mr. Piëch’s dictatorial management style is often seen as a contributing factor in the emissions cheating scandal that has embroiled the company since late 2015. Mr. Piëch has not been directly implicated in the scandal, but he was known for dismissing or sidelining executives who did not meet his high expectations, possibly motivating some of them to resort to deception when they discovered in 2006 that Volkswagen diesel cars could not legally meet American emissions standards.The scandal has cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in legal settlements and fines and focused attention on the controlling families, all of whom are descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, who designed the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler.The Piëch and the Porsche families have been reluctant to appoint outsiders to positions in top management at Volkswagen, opening the company to criticism that it remains dominated by people who were in positions of power as the wrongdoing was unfolding.
                In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.            The management of the holding company and Volkswagen are closely intertwined. Hans Dieter Pötsch, chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board, is also chairman of the Porsche Holding management board. Matthias Müller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, is a member of the Porsche Holding management board. Another member of the holding company’s board is Manfred Döss, Volkswagen’s chief counsel and the person who has overseen efforts to contain the myriad legal challenges that arose from the scandal.Mr. Piëch will retain a small stake in Porsche Holding, but he is unlikely to play an active role in Volkswagen, a company that sometimes seemed to be practically created in his image.Mr. Piëch will remain a member of the Porsche Holding supervisory board at least until the transfer of shares is complete, the company said. It did not say how much the other members of the family were paying for his shares.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He became chief executive of Volkswagen in 1993 and led the company from the brink of bankruptcy to dominance of the European car market and near parity with Toyota, which competes with Volkswagen for the title of world’s largest automaker.Mr. Piëch was also a force in the development of diesel for passenger cars. Diesel engines offered better fuel economy than gasoline motors but also produced more nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of smog. As emissions standards became more stringent, Volkswagen engineers struggled to build compliant engines.AdvertisementIn 2006, according to admissions the company has made in court, Volkswagen decided to install software in cars sold in the United States that could sense when official tests were underway and temporarily activate equipment to control emissions. The equipment was not capable of meeting pollution standards during regular driving. The authoritarian, unforgiving company culture that Mr. Piëch created is seen as one of the elements that led Volkswagen employees to cheat.Mr. Piëch became the chairman of Volkswagen’s supervisory board in 2002 after retiring as chief executive, but he was forced out in 2015, a few months before the emissions cheating became public.A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, Mr. Piëch has had tense relations with other members of the family for decades, and his departure could make it easier to achieve harmony and pave the way for a younger generation to assume more influence.The sale of Mr. Piëch’s share is likely to provoke speculation that he might invest the money in some other way in order to retain influence in the industry to which he has devoted his life. Mr. Piëch has given no public indication of what he might do with the money.A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2017, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Sale of $1 Billion Stake in Volkswagen Will Keep Automaker a Family Affair.
