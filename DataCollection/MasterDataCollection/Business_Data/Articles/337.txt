The global banking giants — think of JPMorgan Chase or HSBC — make a nice return by capturing their share of the trillions of dollars that course through financial markets each day.But few are as reliant on this business — be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives — as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets.And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York.More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of 1.6 trillion euros might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion.AdvertisementThose worries calmed down somewhat late last week as Deutsche Bank’s shares rose after reports that the bank may be close to cutting a deal with the United States Justice Department regarding the fine it must pay for selling toxic mortgages during the financial crisis.AdvertisementThere has also been a growing realization that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche’s chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the “strong fundamentals” of the bank.It has €220 billion, or $247 billion, in ready liquidity, compared with $45 billion for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be.That does not mean, however, that traders and regulators will stop fretting about, among other things, the €42 trillion worth of derivatives that sit on its books, an amount about 11 times the size of the German economy. The market value of that figure, €18 billion, is a lot lower, but as a headline sum it still scares.More than all other universal banks — those institutions that collect deposits and also have investment banking businesses — Deutsche Bank has cultivated bankers with an expertise in conceiving of, promoting and trading some of the most cutting-edge financial instruments around.Its past leader, Anshu Jain, came to the firm in the 1990s from Merrill Lynch and rose to the top through his success in selling derivatives to hedge funds.Long before he became co-chief executive in 2012, Mr. Jain and a loyal cadre of like-minded bankers and traders consolidated power in London (the bank’s headquarters are in Frankfurt), where they established the bank as a behemoth in the markets. Deutsche Bank became one of the few banks large and aggressive enough to put its capital at risk by trading and housing derivatives, securitized mortgages and credit default swaps for those who wanted to deal in them.“What makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary,” said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. “But as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation.”AdvertisementA simple calculation bears this out. Deutsche Bank has €67 billion ($75 billion) in equity that supports assets of €1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion), which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1.By comparison, JPMorgan has $224 billion in cash backing $2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1.Making Deutsche Bank’s ratio more troubling is that many of these assets are of the most illiquid variety, called Level 3 securities, for which establishing a price is guesswork and finding a buyer near impossible.According to the last annual report, Level 3 assets stood at €32 billion — about half the amount of the bank’s equity buffer, although that figure has come down sharply in recent years.
            No lender in the world has more potential to create financial mayhem than Deutsche Bank.        To get a better sense of how these types of assets ended up on its balance sheet, it is worth taking a closer look at the professional makeup of Deutsche Bank’s investment bank.In good times this unit of the bank drove its profits. It was also the investment bank that was largely responsible for the $7.5 billion in losses that Deutsche Bank showed last year.Because of new European Union regulations, Deutsche Bank is required to disclose the number of those who take significant risks with the bank’s capital and how much they are paid.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the British bank reports having just 842 maximum risk takers in its investment bank.While this culture of making big bets with the bank’s cash may have worked in a previous era, in today’s market, where a premium is placed on managing risk as opposed to taking it, such an aptitude becomes a liability.So, even though Deutsche Bank may have a €220 billion cash cushion, it is this unknown liability that is causing some investors to play it safe and ask for their money back.“If you are a counterparty, you have to trim back exposure as fast as you can,” said David Hendler, a credit analyst with Viola Risk Advisors.Most analysts believe that Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra €5 billion to €7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount.But there are a few who think that for Deutsche Bank to be able to survive a crisislike atmosphere, it needs a lot more money than that.Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk.The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank’s stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time.AdvertisementGlobal regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models.As of now, Deutsche Bank is ranked at the top among European banks in terms of risk, requiring close to €100 billion in fresh cash to ensure that it could survive a sustained sell-off in the markets.Other European banks, like BNP Paribas and Société Générale, rank closely behind Deutsche Bank in this regard. What sets Deutsche Bank apart from its European and American peers is its reliance on debt, the N.Y.U. model shows.Since September, the bank’s risk, calculated on the basis of its leverage, has increased sharply relative to other comparable institutions, according to the N.Y.U. gauge.“There is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now,” Mr. Engle said. “We have been worried about European banks for quite a while.”An article on Monday about concerns over Deutsche Bank’s riskier assets misstated a comparison for the amount of derivatives on the German company’s books. The amount — about €42 trillion in derivatives — is equal to about 11 times the size of the German economy; it is not equivalent to the size of the country’s economy.A version of this article appears in print on October 3, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Deutsche’s Taste for Risk Takes a Bite.
