HOUSTON — Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister on Tuesday ruled out the possibility that a recently announced oil production freeze by several countries might lead to cuts to reverse the plunge in oil prices.“There is no sense wasting our time seeking production cuts,” Ali bin Ibrahim al-Naimi told energy executives at the annual IHS CERAweek conference. “That will not happen.”Mr. Naimi’s comments put further pressure on oil prices. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the United States benchmark, turned sharply lower after his remarks and settled at $31.87, down more than 4 percent.Mr. Naimi is widely considered the most influential voice in energy policy in Saudi Arabia, which dominates the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, so his words are followed closely and typically move both energy and equity markets.AdvertisementIn recent days, there had been the prospect that a recent announcement by Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar to cap production at January levels might herald new coordination among producing countries.AdvertisementSaudi Arabia, Russia and Qatar, along with Iraq, have been raising production to compete for Asian markets ever since OPEC refused in late 2014 to cut production. Their growing output has created excess production of one million to two million barrels a day above global demand, leading to near record inventories around the world.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            Saudi Arabia has consistently said it will not curb production when other producing countries refuse to. With Iran preparing to add 500,000 barrels a day to global supplies now that nuclear sanctions have been lifted, the Saudi position has only hardened.Mr. Naimi said that Saudi Arabia hoped that producing countries would get together in March to unite producers and expand the freeze.“If we can get all of the major producers to agree not to add additional barrels, then this high inventory we have now will probably decline in due time,” he said. He added that that was the best that could be hoped for because countries are not likely to abide by any public promises to ease production.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Russian production is already beginning to decline, because of a lack of sufficient investment to replace output lost from aging fields.“If Russia wants to freeze production at January levels it needs to increase production,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, told reporters on Monday.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Plan to Prop Up Oil Prices Won’t Have Support From Saudis.
