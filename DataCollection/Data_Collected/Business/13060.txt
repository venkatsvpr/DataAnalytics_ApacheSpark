LONDON — Barclays said on Thursday that it had agreed to sell its wealth and investment management business in Singapore and in Hong Kong to the Bank of Singapore for $320 million.The sale is part of Barclays’ effort to reshape itself by selling underperforming businesses and focusing on what it considers its core operations.James E. Staley, who became the British bank’s chief executive in December, has outlined a plan to turn it around by accelerating its sale of businesses it does not consider core operations and by focusing its strategy around two divisions: its British consumer bank and its corporate and investment bank.As part of that strategy shift, the bank has said that it plans to scale back the size of its business in Asia and focus on its home markets in Britain and the United States.AdvertisementThe lender also said in March that it would seek to sell down its 62.3 percent interest in Barclays Africa Group over the next two to three years, after agreements to sell its retail banking operations in Italy, Portugal and Spain.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
