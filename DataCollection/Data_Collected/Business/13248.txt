One of the messiest mergers in recent memory reached new levels of messiness late Monday.Energy Transfer Equity — after several attempts in the last few months to sever its pending deal to merge with the Williams Companies — said that its law firm, Latham & Watkins, would not render a certain tax opinion if the transaction were closed today. Williams, after consulting with its own legal advisers, disagreed with that position, according to Monday’s filing.That disclosure sent Energy Transfer’s stock 10 percent higher Monday, while Williams’s shares declined 5 percent, a sign that investors have become more skeptical that the once-$38 billion deal to merge the two pipeline companies will be completed.According to the filing, Latham & Watkins told Energy Transfer that it would no longer be able to deliver a so-called 721 opinion, without providing a reason. Section 721 is a rudimentary provision for transferring assets into a partnership and something that typically does not create any issues in a transaction, according to Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant.As part of the merger agreement, the two companies are required to have a tax opinion from each side’s lawyers for the deal to close.Advertisement“I wish they would say what their hangup is because it’s very mysterious,” Mr. Willens said by phone. “I’ve never heard of a deal floundering because of Section 721.”
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            A representative from Energy Transfer declined to comment beyond Monday’s filing. Representatives from Williams and Latham & Watkins did not respond to a request seeking comment after business hours.AdvertisementEnergy Transfer and its chairman, Kelcy Warren, have tried many tactics that might scuttle the deal with Williams. Energy Transfer, which is based in Dallas, drastically reduced its estimates for how much the merger would affect earnings. It also threatened layoffs at Williams’s headquarters in Tulsa, Okla., to find additional means for cutting costs.Perhaps most upsetting to Williams’s shareholders, though, was a private placement that gave certain Energy Transfer unit holders, notably Mr. Warren, preferential treatment in case the company’s distributions, which are similar to dividends, were cut. That transaction led W illiams to file lawsuits this month — against Energy Transfer in Delaware Court of Chancery and Mr. Warren in the District Court in Dallas — arguing that they breached the merger agreement.At the time, Williams said it was committed to the deal. It does have a way out: a $1.5 billion breakup fee. Williams said in the filing on Monday that it had not changed its recommendation in favor of the merger.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
