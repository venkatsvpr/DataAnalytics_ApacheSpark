The printing unit had revenue of about $1.8 billion in 2015.Hewlett-Packard split into two companies about 10 months ago: HP Enterprise focuses on selling hardware like servers to corporate customers, and HP specializes in personal computers and printers.Last week, HP Enterprise agreed to sell its software assets to Micro Focus of Britain for about $8.8 billion.“The acquisition of Samsung’s printer business allows us to deliver print innovation and create entirely new business opportunities with far better efficiency, security and economics for customers,” Dion Weisler, president and chief executive of HP, said in a news release.The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close within a year.Samsung has agreed to make an equity investment valued at $100 million to $300 million through open-market stock purchases after the deal is completed.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
