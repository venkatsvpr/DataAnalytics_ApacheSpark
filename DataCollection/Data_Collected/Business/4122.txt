But Britain, which is part of the European Union but uses its own currency, the pound, challenged the central bank in the General Court, Europe’s second-highest.The British government, seeking to protect London as a global financial hub, had feared that big clearinghouses like LCH.Clearnet might come under pressure to shift some of its euro-denominated operations to cities on the European Continent, like Paris. Significant sums of money could be at stake. In 2013, LCH Clearnet alone had revenue of 380 million euros, or about $425 million.The legal action had become something of a political test case for Britain, where a public debate is underway about how much influence the country has and should have within the European Union — and even, among some politicians, whether Britain should remain part of the bloc.British policy makers have also long suspected that rival financial centers in Frankfurt and Paris would try to take advantage of Britain’s self-exclusion from the euro currency union to lure business from London. Clearinghouses, including the London operations of CME Clearing Europe and ICE Clear Europe, are intermediaries in trades like stocks, bonds or derivatives and ensure that transactions are completed even if one party fails to honor its obligations.After the court ruling was announced, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described it as a “major win for Britain and a major win for all those who want to see a European economy that is both open and successful.”In a statement, Mr. Osborne also argued that the ruling upheld the primacy of Europe’s single market, which ensures the freedom to trade throughout the union, which has a population of around 500 million.“We have been consistently clear there needs to be a level playing field for all countries in Europe’s single market, whether they are in the eurozone or not,” Mr. Osborne said.The European Central Bank said in a statement on Wednesday that it would “carefully consider the General Court’s judgment and decide on the way forward as soon as such analysis will be completed.”Wednesday’s ruling came at a sensitive time in Britain. A general election is set for May, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised that, if re-elected, he will hold a referendum by 2017 on British membership in the European Union.Critics of the bloc would have gained fresh ammunition had the ruling, from the Luxembourg-based General Court of the European Union, gone the other way.Underlying Mr. Osborne’s legal challenge was a worry that, as the 19-nation eurozone integrates more closely after its debt crisis, Britain will be increasingly marginalized.Even supporters of British membership in the European Union sometimes fear that divisions between those inside and outside the eurozone could undermine the bloc’s single market — a key attraction for the British.At issue was a policy laid out by the European Central Bank in July 2011, which said that bodies that settle euro-denominated transactions should be legally incorporated in the euro area. Full managerial and operational control and responsibility, overall core functions, should be exercised from within that single currency zone, it suggested.The European Central Bank argued that oversight would be easier if clearing houses with a net daily credit exposure of more than 5 billion euros, or about $5.6 billion, were in the eurozone.The court ruled that such a requirement went beyond oversight and strayed into regulation. The court concluded that the central bank did not have the legal right to regulate the activity of securities clearing systems.The ruling was welcomed by Britain’s main business lobby organization, the Confederation of British Industry, whose director general, John Cridland, described it as a “landmark judgment upholding the E.U.’s single market, setting the boundaries of what the E.C.B. can do to support the eurozone without the agreement of non-euro member states.”Integration of the eurozone “cannot and should not compromise the principle of the single market,” Mr. Cridland added.But there was a more skeptical reaction from Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Business for Britain, an organization that wants a renegotiation of the terms of Britain’s membership in the European Union and a referendum on whether to stay.Mr. Elliott described the ruling as “good news” but added, “it’s a pity that the U.K. was forced to resort to such drastic measures in the first place.”“We have a wider battle to win to protect our position as a non-eurozone member state, and we need to vehemently resist any attempts to introduce this policy via the other European institutions,” he said.The European Central Bank could appeal, on legal points, to Europe’s top court, the European Court of Justice, which is also in Luxembourg.Advertisement
