Apple told a federal court on Friday that it should not have to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by a Brooklyn drug dealer and that the case would lead to “an avalanche” of similar demands if prosecutors prevailed.Apple’s lawyers, in a new filing in Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York, said that a judge should uphold an earlier ruling that the Justice Department had gone beyond its authority in demanding Apple’s technical help.The filing was the latest in an intense dispute that began two months ago when the F.B.I. sought Apple’s help to gain access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14 people.
                The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.            The F.B.I. was able to get into the iPhone associated with the San Bernardino case without Apple’s help last month after paying an undisclosed third party to demonstrate how to work around the defenses built into the phone.AdvertisementBut the F.B.I. says that solution will not work on other types of phones, and the Justice Department has gone to court to seek Apple’s help in getting into the phone in the Brooklyn drug case as well as a case in Boston involving a gang.AdvertisementIn the filing on Friday, Apple’s lawyers said that the Justice Department had failed to show that the company’s help was really necessary in the Brooklyn case. Moreover, they asserted that the iPhone would most likely produce “minimal evidentiary value” anyway, because it was last used two years ago and the phone’s owner, Jun Feng, and the other defendants in the methamphetamine case had already pleaded guilty.Emily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said on Friday that the help prosecutors were seeking from Apple was minimal. And she noted that Apple had provided similar assistance 70 times before without objection until recent months.“Apple has said it would take them only a few hours to open this kind of phone, because they already have the mechanism that would allow them to do so,” Ms. Pierce said.A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Apple Again Resists Call  to Help in New York Case.
