Aimed at creating the world’s largest trading zone, T.T.I.P. faces stiff headwinds in Europe and the United States after years of negotiations.The ruling on Thursday concerned a series of complaints against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, known as CETA.Those who filed the complaints wanted the German government to be legally required to vote against CETA at a European Union meeting next week. That would give the court time to consider allegations that the pact violated the principles of democracy.Despite rejecting the complaints, the court attached conditions to the decision on Thursday that would seek to address the concerns.Sigmar Gabriel, the German vice chancellor and economy minister, had warned that delaying the signing of CETA could destroy the trade deal.CETA was expected to be signed at a summit meeting later this month between Canada and European Union member states, before being submitted for ratification next year.Mr. Gabriel said he was “very satisfied” with the judgment and cast the success with the Canadian agreement as paving the way for an eventual deal on T.T.I.P.“It is also a step toward regulating globalization,” said Mr. Gabriel, who has faced strong opposition in his Social Democratic Party to both trade pacts. He is also anxious not to lose voters over the issue before federal elections next year.CETA has drawn the ire of many in Europe who see it as a blueprint for the larger T.T.I.P.Last month, thousands demonstrated against both deals outside the European Union’s offices in Brussels. Opponents argue that the agreements undermine environmental regulations while also damaging labor and consumer rights.Troubles had arisen with CETA, Mr. Gabriel said, because some protesters had confused it with T.T.I.P. “I think that’s a great mistake,” he added.Advertisement
