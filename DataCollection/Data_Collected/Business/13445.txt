By contrast, industrial output fell 0.4 percent and construction output was down 0.9 percent.Manufacturing and construction output had the steepest drops in annual terms since early 2013.While consumer demand — a pillar of British economic growth — has remained broadly solid, retail sales dropped, adding to signs of a slowdown.Advertisement
