In a significant consolidation of movie theater holdings, AMC Entertainment will acquire Carmike Cinemas for about $737 million in cash, forming the country’s largest chain with more than 600 theaters, the companies said on Thursday.Under the terms of the deal, AMC will pay $30 a share, up 19 percent from Carmike’s closing price on Thursday. Including the assumption of Carmike’s debt, the transaction is valued at about $1.1 billion.The deal is the biggest by AMC since it returned to the public markets in a 2013 stock sale. And it represents a bold effort by AMC’s controlling investor, Wang Jianlin of China’s Dalian Wanda Group, to consolidate the American cinema industry.Dalian Wanda agreed in January to buy Legendary Entertainment, a film production and finance company, for about $3.5 billion. It bought AMC in 2012 for about $2.6 billion, and is building a large commercial and residential complex in Beverly Hills, Calif., adjacent to the Beverly Hilton hotel, where the Golden Globes and other Hollywood events take place.AdvertisementAMC, based in Leawood, Kan., is the country’s second-biggest movie theater chain with 5,426 screens, behind the Regal Entertainment Group. It is particularly strong in large markets, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
                With the announced acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC Entertainment is poised to control one out of every five theaters in the country.            Carmike, based in Columbus, Ga., has most of its 2,954 screens in midsize cities. The combined companies will be based in Leawood, they said.AdvertisementBy comparison, Regal operated 7,361 screens and 572 theaters as of year end.AMC said the deal would increase the geographic spread of its theaters, while allowing it to trim expenses by consolidating administrative operations for the two companies. The company estimated the merger would yield about $35 million in annual cost savings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

JPMorgan Chase and the law firm King & Spalding advised Carmike.A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: AMC Deal Will Create Largest Cinema Chain in U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
