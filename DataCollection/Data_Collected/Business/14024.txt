Reed, Verizon’s chief administrative officer, characterized the deal as “consistent with our objective of creating high-quality American jobs and achieving meaningful changes and enhancements to the contracts that will better enable our wireline business unit to compete and succeed in the digital world.”The dispute centered on Verizon’s desire to be able to outsource more work, including to foreign countries, and to gain more freedom to transfer workers inside the United States. The company also sought concessions on worker pensions as revenue growth slowed in the so-called wireline side of its business, which includes landline phones and video and Internet service transmitted through wires.The profitability of this business has declined in recent years as more people abandon landlines and rely on wireless. Growth in subscribers to Verizon’s Fios service, which provides telephone, video and Internet service, has also slowed.The unions said Verizon was deliberately neglecting and in some cases smothering its wireline business, noting that wireline workers typically earn more in pay and benefits than their counterparts on the wireless side, which are mostly nonunion.In particular, the unions and other critics said that the lucrative Fios, which is a source of high-paying jobs, could be expanded significantly, but Verizon had lost interest.“Most of the wireline workers were building Fios, which is the most advanced broadband network there is,” said Robert Master, assistant to the vice president of District 1 of the Communication Workers. “It’s highly profitable and getting more profitable.”To maintain its operations during the strike, Verizon had dispatched managers and nonunion workers to call centers and field service assignments.After weeks of tension, talks began to make progress in mid-May. The turnaround coincided with the involvement of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.“We believe Secretary Perez and the director of the F.M.C.S. were a helpful addition to the bargaining process,” said Richard Young, a Verizon spokesman. “They were clearly helpful.”One apparent factor in resolving the standoff was that Verizon, which had predicted that the strike would not materially affect its business, had begun to feel an economic pinch.Last week, the company’s chief financial officer acknowledged that the strike could be having a negative effect because the nonunion employees who were filling in for striking workers focused on maintaining the existing network, not new installations.Verizon also faced growing political pressure. Eighty-eight members of the House issued a joint statement last week expressing concern about the strike, and about 15 municipalities in Verizon’s service area, which runs from Virginia to Massachusetts, have passed resolutions siding with striking workers.When it came to wireless customers, the union believed it had won a public relations victory.“The picketing of wireless stores was extremely effective,” said Mr. Master. “That is the public facing side of company.”Mr. Young, the Verizon spokesman, rejected that claim.But the strain on workers was growing as well, particularly after May 1, when the company discontinued health benefits to striking workers.The battle between the company and the unions was not entirely limited to the wireline business. Among the striking workers were roughly 65 workers at Verizon Wireless stores, who will receive their first contract despite having unionized in 2014.While the numbers are small, it is the first contract for retail wireless workers at Verizon, and could be an important precedent.videoAdvertisement
