In the live-music business, the most visible kind of competition is over who books the big stars. But behind the scenes, there is a never-ending contest over ticketing, with promoters, venues and technology companies making deals for the sales as well as the customer data that comes with them.Last year, Pandora Media paid $450 million for Ticketfly, an online ticketing service that competes with Ticketmaster to sign up clubs and theaters and has deals with 1,200 clients, including promoters and venues. Now Ticketfly has reached a deal to be the exclusive ticketing provider for the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge, two of the most beloved clubs in New York. Both organizations, which were longtime Ticketmaster clients, announced on Thursday that they would switch to Ticketfly on Sunday.The deal is partly of symbolic importance for Ticketfly. The Bowery Ballroom — which Rolling Stone has called the best club in the country — has an estimated annual attendance of only about 130,000, and the Mercury Lounge just 80,000, according to a marketing document from the Bowery Presents, a promoter that is affiliated with the clubs but does not own them.The deal also extends the reach of Ticketfly in New York. Among the other venues it works with in the city are Central Park SummerStage, Forest Hills Stadium, Brooklyn Bowl, Output and Birdland. The Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge agreement comes as the Bowery Presents is in talks to be acquired by the giant concert company AEG Live, but the Ticketfly deal is not expected to affect that transaction.Since it was founded in 2008, Ticketfly has been favored by many smaller promoters and venues for its technology and marketing abilities. Since Ticketfly was bought by Pandora, the wider music industry has been awaiting the integration of those two companies, which both said would allow much more extensive kinds of online marketing than had been available to promoters before.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
