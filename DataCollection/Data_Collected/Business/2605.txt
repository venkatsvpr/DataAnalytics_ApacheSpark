The CME Group said on Thursday that it had increased its offer to acquire the GFI Group, a New York brokerage and clearing house, as it tries to stave off a competing hostile bid by BGC Partners.In a news release, CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange, said GFI shareholders would receive $5.60 a share in cash and stock under the latest revised offer.That is up from $5.25 a share in cash and CME stock proposed last month and 80 percent above GFI’s closing price before the first bid was announced in July.Shares of GFI rose 2 percent, to $5.56, in early trading in New York on Thursday.If it wins the bidding competition, CME plans to sell GFI’s wholesale brokerage business to a group led by GFI’s management.As part of the revised bid, the management consortium has agreed to pay about $282 million in cash, up from its previous offer of $254 million, CME said. The group would also assume $77 million of unvested compensation and other liabilities.The revised offer comes a day after BGC Partners, which is headed by Howard W. Lutnick, the chairman and chief executive of the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, raised its own bid to $5.60 a share in cash. On Thursday, CME said the terms of the revised transaction had been approved by GFI’s board, which continued to recommend that shareholders approve the deal.The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. A shareholder meeting is set for Jan. 27.If approved by shareholders, CME says it expects the transaction to close shortly thereafter.A version of this article appears in print on 01/16/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Sweetened Bid.
