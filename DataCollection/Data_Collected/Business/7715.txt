Thain, who ran Merrill Lynch when it was sold to Bank of America in the depth of the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Thain took over CIT not long after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.The $3.4 billion acquisition of OneWest will nearly double the size of CIT.It is a boon to the private equity investors who bought up the soured assets of IndyMac with help from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and have collected billions from their investment in the renamed OneWest.The combined company, which will be called the CIT Group, will have more than $65 billion in assets and more than $30 billion of deposits.“We welcome OneWest employees to CIT and we look forward to working with them to meet the needs of small and middle market businesses, the transportation industry, real estate sector and our retail bank customers,” Mr. Thain said in a statement.Consumer advocates opposed the merger, saying that OneWest had a poor track record in fulfilling its obligations to the Community Reinvestment Act, a law designed to ensure that banks serve lower income and minority neighborhoods.Some also took issue with OneWest’s foreclosures practices, particularly in its reverse mortgage unit. This winter, federal banking regulators hosted a rare public hearing in California to allow the public to air their feelings about the merger.As a condition of approving the merger, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency said that CIT must satisfy several requirements related to the Community Reinvestment Act, including that it create a special committee dedicated to developing banking products for low and moderate-income communities and report on its progress regularly to banking regulators and the public.The deal is likely to ease concerns among analysts and deal makers that bank regulators are hostile toward mergers in the industry. Since the financial crisis, there have been several deals that have been held up for months – even years – amid intense scrutiny.Advertisement
