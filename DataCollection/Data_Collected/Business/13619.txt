Medivation’s directors unanimously rejected the offer.Shares of Medivation have risen since the offer was made on speculation that another bidder might step in or Sanofi might increase its offer. The company’s shares rose 1 percent in midday trading on Thursday, to $59.65. Medivation was scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings on Thursday after the markets closed.“I want to reiterate our preference to engage with you to negotiate a transaction,” Mr. Brandicourt said in the letter. “We believe immediate engagement would be in the best interests of your shareholders as it would enable them promptly to realize substantial and certain value, while minimizing the disruption to your organization.”Mr. Brandicourt, who took over as chief executive last year after Christopher A. Viehbacher was ousted, has said that Sanofi is interested in medium-size acquisitions and that cancer treatment is an area of interest.Advertisement
