AdvertisementSupported byBy Patricia CohenThree months ago, Dan Price, the chief executive of Gravity Payments, a credit card processing company, decided to raise the salary of his lowest paid workers to $70,000. Almost overnight, he represented a swashbuckling blow against income inequality. He also drew no small amount of criticism.People argued about whether he was a brilliant visionary or an inept do-gooder, or whether his attempt to address inequality ended up undermining fairness.As Mr. Price himself acknowledged: “There’s no perfect way to do this and no way to handle complex workplace issues that doesn’t have any downsides or trade-offs. I came up with the best solution I could.”Can you come up with a better one? We are promoting you to chief executive of a small, private and profitable company like Gravity. Your first task?
