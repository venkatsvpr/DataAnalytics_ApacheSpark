The deal was valued around $38 billion, including debt, when it was  reached in September.Energy Transfer cited the inability of its lawyers to deliver the “required tax opinion” as a reason for terminating the agreement. Last week, Sam Glasscock III, the vice chancellor of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, sided with Energy Transfer, which had argued in part that the transaction may not ultimately be deemed tax-free — a condition for the deal to close.Despite Energy Transfer’s announcement early Wednesday, the fight over the deal is far from over.Shareholders of Williams, which is based in Tulsa, Okla., voted at a special meeting on Monday to approve the transaction, and the company filed papers to begin the appeal process in the Delaware Supreme Court.In September, after months of trying to negotiate a deal, Energy Transfer agreed to acquire its rival in a transaction that valued Williams at $43.50 a share. Energy Transfer had tried to buy Williams a year ago, but its earlier offer — worth about $48 billion — was rejected.But Energy Transfer appeared to have a bit of buyer’s remorse as commodity prices continued to fall last year and its investors raised concerns about the $6 billion in cash portion of the deal.Shares of Energy Transfer closed up 6 percent at $14.41 on Tuesday, while shares of Williams were up 3 percent, at $20.64.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
