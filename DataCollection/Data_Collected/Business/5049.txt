The proposal was rejected in an 8-to-1 vote.Financial markets are focusing on the April 30 meeting, when the board will review its long-term projections and may further cut its inflation forecast.When it began the stimulus program in April 2013, the Bank of Japan pledged to achieve 2 percent inflation in about two years in a country mired in 15 years of deflation. The bank now says inflation will hit 2 percent around the ending of this fiscal year, in March 2016. Advertisement
