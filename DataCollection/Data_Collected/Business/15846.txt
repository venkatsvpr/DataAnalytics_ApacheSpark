Paul Walsh, the former chief executive of the spirits maker Diageo, and Henri de Castries, the chairman and chief executive of the French insurer AXA, joined the board earlier this year. Mr. de Castries retired from AXA this month.The addition of Mr. Tai came as HSBC has moved in the last 15 months to significantly reshape its business by shedding tens of thousands of jobs, by selling underperforming businesses and shrinking its global investment banking business.The bank has faced pressure on its results in recent quarters, including difficult markets to begin the year and uncertainty following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
