A recent report in The Financial Times suggested that the company would require a 9 percent annual return to sustain that kind of loss.“Against the backdrop of a volatile market, we are taking immediate action to boost revenues and reduce our cost base in order to safeguard Guardian journalism in perpetuity,” Mr. Pemsel said in a statement.The company said it aimed to double revenue from readers with an enhanced membership offer, better align its editorial and commercial operations, and improve its advertising offerings to better track market trends like branded content, video and data.It will also continue to place its international focus on growth on the United States and Australia and create a data team to support both the company’s editorial offerings and its commercial enterprises.The Guardian, a left-wing British broadsheet newspaper, aggressively expanded on the web in recent years, and sought to establish a presence in the United States and Australia. Those efforts met with journalistic success — in 2014, the newspaper shared the Pulitzer Prize for public service, its first, with The Washington Post for articles based on National Security Agency documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.But, as for most publishing companies, financial success has been harder to attain as traditional revenue streams, most notably print advertising, have declined.“Over the next three years,” Ms. Viner said, “a growing and far deeper set of relationships with our audience will result in a reimagining of our journalism, a sustainable business model and a newly focused digital organization that reflects our independence and our mission.”The company did not disclose precise details of the plan, but said that an “implementation timetable and further details” would be communicated in the coming months. The Financial Times suggested that the plan would include job losses.The company declined to comment on potential layoffs.Advertisement
