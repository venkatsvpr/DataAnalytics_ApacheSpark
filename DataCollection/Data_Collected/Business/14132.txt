Daniel Craig will star and Todd Field, the director of “Little Children,” will direct. Mr. Franzen, Mr. Field and the playwright David Hare will be among the show’s writers, and Scott Rudin is one of the executive producers.The network said that production would begin next year, and that the limited series would run over two years.Showtime’s “Purity” will be the latest example of what has become an increasingly popular form of TV. Television executives have said that limited series are an easier way to attract high-level talent who do not have to commit for multiple seasons. They have also said that it is a useful vehicle to excite viewers who are confronted with more television programs than ever before. The first season of FX’s “American Crime Story” about the O. J. Simpson trial ranks as the highest-rated new series on cable for the year.This is not Mr. Franzen’s first experience with TV. His award-winning novel “The Corrections” was developed by HBO but never made it to television.Advertisement
