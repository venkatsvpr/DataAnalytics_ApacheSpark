Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest beverage company, said on Thursday that it spent more on health research and partnerships than it previously disclosed, as part of its push to be more transparent. The company first disclosed its spending on health-related efforts after facing criticism for its funding of the Global Energy Balance Network, a group that said its mission was to fight obesity. That group has since disbanded. In an effort to be more transparent, Coca-Cola said it would disclose all its spending on scientific research and health partnerships. In its initial disclosure in September, the company said it spent $118.6 million on the efforts between 2010 and 2015. On Thursday, Coke said a more thorough internal investigation found that the figure was $132.8 million.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
