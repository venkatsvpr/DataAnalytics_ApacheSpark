It reported revenue of 70.8 billion kroner in 2015 and employs 6,700 people.A Goldman Sachs investment in Dong Energy nearly led to a collapse of the Danish government in 2014. A Goldman-controlled entity owns 17.8 percent of the company.JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Nordea Bank Danmark are acting as joint global coordinators on the offering.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
