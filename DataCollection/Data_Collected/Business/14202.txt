Try to carry on!”Ms. Guthrie said she would “hold down the fort” from New York. “We’re going to be in the height of the campaign season, so we’ll be here,” she said.NBC and NBC Universal cable stations will broadcast the Olympics from Aug. 5 to Aug. 21.Brazil has recently had a surge in babies born with microcephaly, a condition in which their heads are abnormally small.
