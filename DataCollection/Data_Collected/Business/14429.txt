AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersShares in National Bank of Abu Dhabi and First Gulf Bank soared on Sunday after they confirmed discussions of a possible merger. A combination would create one of the largest banks in the Middle East and Africa.Both banks have close links to the Abu Dhabi government, which has been cutting costs and restructuring its assets to increase efficiency as low oil prices take a toll on its revenues.Analysts said a merger could start a wave of consolidation in the United Arab Emirates banking sector, which is crowded with more than 50 banks and squeezed by lower government spending and tougher global capital rules.In a statement on Sunday, the banks, Abu Dhabi’s largest and third-largest lenders by assets, said each had formed a working group to “review the commercial potential along with any legal and structural aspects of a merger or combination.” The groups would provide recommendations to their respective boards.Local investors welcomed the idea of an Abu Dhabi mega-bank, pushing shares of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi up by their 15 percent daily limit on Sunday while shares in First Gulf Bank rose 11.5 percent. Shares in other Abu Dhabi banks climbed on speculation that they might eventually be involved in mergers.The National Bank of Abu Dhabi is 70 percent owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, and First Gulf Bank is controlled by members of the emirate’s royal family.A larger bank would help Abu Dhabi’s aspiration to become a major financial center. The emirate is starting a financial free zone, Abu Dhabi Global Market, to attract foreign investment.A merger would create a bank with assets worth around 627 billion dirhams ($171 billion), according to figures for the first quarter of 2016.That would exceed the first-quarter assets of the region’s current largest bank by assets, Qatar National Bank, which had 550 billion riyals ($150 billion) at the end of the first quarter. Qatar National Bank, however, completed its acquisition of Finansbank of Turkey last week, which could keep it ahead.Advertisement
