He was responsible for greenlighting well-known series like “Game of Thrones,” “Veep” and “True Detective.”Mr. Lombardo, 60, is expected to continue to work at HBO for several months to help with the transition to a new creative leadership team. He is also working out the details for a production deal with HBO.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Lombardo said that he started thinking about leaving as he faced his 60s.“The thing that I love the most about what I have been doing is working with talent, and the truth about my job is that is only a fraction of it,” Mr. Lombardo said. “So this just felt like the next step. I would so much rather do it at my home HBO than elsewhere.”On Mr. Lombardo’s watch, HBO reigned at the Emmy Awards. This year, it won 43, 31 more than any other network.But HBO has recently entered a bit of a rough patch on the creative front. Critics gave its new drama “Vinyl” a lackluster reception.Mr. Lombardo said that he had hesitated to leave on a down note, before adding that the network’s programming remains strong.“There are always these cycles of up and down and hot or not,” Mr. Lombardo said.Mr. Lombardo was named president of programming at HBO in 2007 after having worked as the network’s chief deal maker as its head of business affairs on the West Coast. Mr. Lombardo started at HBO in 1983.“I never intended to be a company man my whole life,” Mr. Lombardo said. “I just felt like if I don’t do this now, I am never going to do it.”Advertisement
