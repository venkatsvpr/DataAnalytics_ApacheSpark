GO Scale Capital is sponsored by GSR Ventures and Oak Investment Partners.Philips, which would retain the remaining 19.9 percent, would receive $2.8 billion in cash and a deferred contingent payment of up to $100 million. The deal values the business around $3.3 billion in total.“Philips is very positive about this transaction with GO Scale Capital,” Frans van Houten, the Philips chief executive, said in a news release, adding, “We have significantly improved the performance of the LED components business and optimized the industrial footprint in the automotive lighting business over the last few years, and established a strong management team and innovation pipeline.”The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter and requires regulatory approval.After the deal, the company would continue to operate under the name Lumileds with Pierre-Yves Lesaicherre as chief executive.The Lumileds business posted sales of about $2 billion in 2014. It has operations in more than 30 countries and about 8,300 employees worldwide.The announcement is the latest move by Philips as it restructures operations to focus on growth areas.In September, Philips, based in Amsterdam, said it planned to split its remaining businesses into two companies: one focused on health care and technology, and the other on lighting.Philips said in March that it planned to spin off its remaining lighting business, known as Lighting Solutions, in an initial public offering next year, but that it was also reviewing other options.Lighting Solutions includes three divisions that cover offerings like traditional light bulbs and complete lighting systems. It will remain an important customer of Lumileds after the transaction.Advertisement
