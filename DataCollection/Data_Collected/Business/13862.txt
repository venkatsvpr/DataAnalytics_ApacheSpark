Foxx cited recent incidents that showed the devices could catch fire during transport. Passengers may continue to carry e-cigarettes for personal use in carry-on baggage or on their person, but may not use them on flights, Mr. Foxx said.“Banning e-cigarettes from checked bags is a prudent and important safety measure,” Mr. Foxx said in a statement.The rule covers battery-powered portable electronic smoking devices including e-cigarettes, e-cigars and e-pipes, but does not prohibit passengers from transporting other devices containing batteries for personal use, like laptop computers or cellphones.The rule makes permanent a temporary ban instituted in November. The use of e-cigarettes was barred by the department in a separate move in March. No airline has allowed their use.The government cited two incidents of an e-cigarette catching fire in luggage in the last two years. It said the danger was worsened by the growing trend of smokers’ modifying or rebuilding their e-cigarette devices.The Transportation Department said it took the action to eliminate any confusion over whether its existing ban on smoking, which dates to 2000, includes electronic cigarettes.Advertisement
