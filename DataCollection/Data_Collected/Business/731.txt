The first battle in the legal assault on Volkswagen is unfolding as plaintiffs’ lawyers jockey over where tens of thousands of claims should be heard and which lawyers will get the biggest piece of the action.Across the United States, more than 350 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of consumers against Volkswagen over its rigged diesel vehicles, according to a law firm representing the company. To streamline the sprawling litigation, a panel of federal judges is expected to send those cases soon to a single court where a judge will appoint a small group of plaintiffs’ lawyers to steer the case.This approach has been used dozens of times in mass lawsuits involving cars, drugs and other products. But concern is growing among legal scholars that a small circle of law firms has come to dominate the process and that some settlements have benefited the lawyers more than their clients.One recent study found that about two dozen firms played leading roles in 10 or more major lawsuits. Five of those firms spearheaded 20 or more.AdvertisementLegal scholars say the prevalence of such “repeat players,” which earn the biggest fees, may create an environment that is detrimental to plaintiffs. The worry is that lawyers may fear opposing settlement terms because they do not want to be frozen out of future cases.“This does not lead to a healthy atmosphere for dissent,” said Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, who wrote the study.Last month, Volkswagen officials said they were setting aside $7.3 billion to deal with the fallout from the scandal, in which the company used software to make it appear that its diesel cars were meeting air emissions standards. Volkswagen recently acknowledged that the deception’s eventual costs may be far higher than estimated. Along with lawsuits from car buyers in the United States and abroad, the company also faces actions from regulators and state attorneys general.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            In their lawsuits, consumers are arguing that Volkswagen defrauded them with false claims about the performance of its diesel engines and are asking to be compensated for the premium prices paid for the vehicles and the cars’ diminished resale value. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers are demanding the Volkswagen buy back the cars“That is the doomsday scenario for VW,” said Hunter J. Shkolnik, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in New York.AdvertisementWith so much money at stake, a chase by lawyers for top positions in the Volkswagen case has already begun.In early December, a seven-judge committee known as the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is expected to hear arguments at a hearing in New Orleans about where to consolidate the federal lawsuits against Volkswagen.Lawyers, in filings, are already trying to make their case for jurisdictions that they consider favorable for them. Eager to find a judge they have worked with, lawyers are also making pitches about which one should handle the Volkswagen litigation.A lawyer in Minneapolis, Charles S. Zimmerman, is calling for the case to be heard in Detroit because it is the “Motor City.” A San Diego lawyer, Benjamin Galdston, says it should be heard near Los Angeles because many Volkswagen lawsuits have been filed there. And a lawyer in Dallas, Warren T. Burns, would like to see the Volkswagen case moved to Alexandria, Va., because the carmaker’s United States headquarters building is nearby in Herndon, Va. “Everyone wants to find the best place for this case,” said Robert Hilliard, a lawyer in Corpus Christi, Tex., who has asked the panel to send the Volkswagen case there.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Those posts carry prestige — law firms promote the roles on their websites — and the potential to make tens of millions of dollars in added fees.The lead lawyers, and others they appoint to handle tasks like reviewing corporate documents or interviewing witnesses, get more money. That is because their work benefits all lawyers nationwide who have plaintiffs in the consolidated case. To compensate them, other lawyers are required to hand over a small percentage of their contingency fees, and claimants usually are required to give up a small fraction of their settlement payouts to cover the lead lawyers’ expenses.Richard J. Arsenault, a lawyer in Louisiana who has played leading roles in 17 mass lawsuits, said it was essential to have experienced lawyers with financial resources because they are opposing defense firms and companies with deep pockets.But legal scholars such as Ms. Burch are concerned that lawyers, who get paid when a case is resolved, may be open to settlement terms that might favor them more than some clients.The result, critics argue, can create inconsistent outcomes for plaintiffs.As part of 2013 settlement of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson involving a flawed artificial replacement hip, patients who chose not to hire a lawyer were required to forfeit 29 percent of their award, a charge that reduced payouts by $50,000 or more. Plaintiffs’ lawyers justified the deduction by saying that the patients who had hired lawyers paid them a third of their award as a fee.AdvertisementBut awards to claimants without lawyers who were involved in a mass settlement against Bayer A.G. over a genetically engineered strain of rice were reduced by only 11 percent. Don M. Downing, a lawyer in St. Louis who helped negotiate the Bayer settlement, said that people who did not hire a lawyer had to do much the same work to file a claim.“They had to spend a lot of time finding and putting together records,” he said.In the drive to settle, ethical boundaries may also get pushed, critics say. Under a settlement, lawyers in a mass case against Merck over Vioxx, a painkiller linked to heart attacks, were required to recommend the deal’s terms to all their clients if they wanted any of them to participate.As a result, lawyers who had clients who might have fared better financially by going to trial had to convince them that the settlement was in their interest, said Howard M. Erichson, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law. Otherwise, he said, the lawyers could no longer represent those clients.“They essentially had to fire a client,” Mr. Erichson said. Lawyers involved in the Vioxx case said that legal ethicists reviewed the provision and approved it.Last week, a lawyer in Texas, Mikal C. Watts, who has helped lead several mass cases, was indicted on federal charges that he fraudulently claimed to represent thousands of people seeking to recover damages from BP in connection with the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion. Those people, according to prosecutors, either did not exist or were unaware they had asked for representation. Robert B. McDuff, a lawyer for Mr. Watts, denied that he had done anything wrong, saying the problems resulted from paperwork errors.Mr. Shkolnik, the New York lawyer, said the number of lawyers positioning themselves for leading roles in the Volkswagen case appeared to be unprecedented. Mr. Arsenault, the Louisiana lawyer who has repeatedly played a leading role in mass cases, is watching the Volkswagen litigation unfold before deciding whether to jump in, but he is poised to do so.On the day before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is scheduled meet in New Orleans, Mr. Arsenault plans to host a symposium there for plaintiffs’ lawyers who have sued Volkswagen. He has even arranged for a well-known speaker to address the gathering: Ralph Nader, the car safety advocate.An article on Tuesday about plaintiffs’ lawyers who are jockeying for position in lawsuits stemming from Volkswagen’s emissions scandal misstated the number of judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which will hear arguments about where to consolidate the federal lawsuits. There are seven judges, counting the chairwoman, not six.A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Lawyers Jostle for Lead Position in Volkswagen Diesel Suits .
