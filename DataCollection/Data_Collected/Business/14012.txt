Wherever we can reduce costs without damaging the values, and value, of Times journalism, we will do so.”In an interview, Mr. Baquet characterized the buyouts as “a big step toward building The New York Times of the future.” He said The Times was not planning layoffs this year but would take other measures to cut costs in some areas and dedicate resources to other areas.“I don’t want to speculate about next year,” he said, addressing layoffs, “other than to say I’ve made it very clear the newsroom has to be somewhat smaller. Not radically smaller, but somewhat smaller.”Mr. Baquet also emphasized that The Times’s news operation, which employs 1,300 people, would need to shift to accommodate more people with skills in visual journalism and more people from diverse backgrounds, while continuing its focus on deep reporting.“One of the goals of journalism is to play the world back to itself,” he said. “You can’t do that if you don’t look a little bit more like the world than we do.”Since January, company leaders have sent more than 10 memos detailing aggressive efforts to reshape both the print and digital editions of the operation, including building a print-focused news hub, investing in Facebook Live, expanding internationally and beginning a Spanish-language edition.The underlying message has been constant: Growth will not come without changes, and some cuts. Last month, The Times announced that it would close its editing and prepress print production operations in Paris.It is a time of upheaval in the news industry after a period of ambitious growth. As media companies struggle to compensate for plummeting advertising revenue while chasing new technologies, like virtual reality, layoffs and revamping plans have become the norm. On Tuesday, Vice Media announced that it would lay off more than a dozen employees, and a string of reorganization efforts have been undertaken at other outlets, including Mashable and The Guardian.This is the first round of buyouts offered since The Times announced in October 2014 that it would cut about 100 newsroom jobs. Layoffs happened two months later because The Times did not receive enough voluntary buyouts.The announcement on Wednesday did not specify the number of buyouts that would be offered, but it said packages would be distributed electronically to all eligible employees on May 31, who would then have until mid-July to consider the offer.As with previous buyouts, the company can accept or deny buyout applications.The Times is negotiating with the NewsGuild on a new contract, and both are still working out the final terms of the buyout offer.“This buyout offers an excellent opportunity for some employees to leave on their own terms,” Grant Glickson, the chairman of the Guild unit at The Times, said in an email.Advertisement
