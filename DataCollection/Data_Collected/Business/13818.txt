AdvertisementSupported byBy Leslie PickerPfizer has signed its first acquisition since terminating its $152 billion merger with Allergan about a month ago.Pfizer will acquire Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion, the companies announced Monday. Anacor has developed a product, currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration, known as crisaborole, to treat eczema. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., also makes a topical treatment called Kerydin for a form of toenail fungus.Over the last few years, Pfizer had been trying to make big bets overseas in an effort to become more competitive and lower its tax bill. After terminating deals with AstraZeneca and most recently, Allergan, Pfizer has turned to relatively smaller, American biotechnology companies for acquisitions. Pfizer may decide to split its company in two, with brand-name products on one side and older, generic products on the other.Anacor’s drugs would fit with the innovative business, said Albert Bourla, group president of Pfizer’s global innovative pharma and global vaccines, oncology and consumer health care businesses.“We believe we are well positioned to maximize crisaborole’s commercial potential through our strong relationships with pediatricians and primary care physicians,” Mr. Bourla said in the statement on Monday.Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will acquire Anacor for $99.25 a share in cash. That represents a 55 percent premium over Anacor’s closing stock price from Friday. Pfizer plans to finance the transaction through existing cash on its balance sheet.Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2016. The company said the transaction would be slightly dilutive to earnings per share in 2017 and accretive the following year.Centerview Partners and Guggenheim Securities provided financial advice to Pfizer, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal advice. Anacor was advised by Citigroup and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.Advertisement
