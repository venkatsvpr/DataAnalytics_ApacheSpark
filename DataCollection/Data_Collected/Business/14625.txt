The advance made over Tuesday and Wednesday erased more than half of the losses the American market absorbed in the two-day slide that started on Friday.Britain’s stock market has recouped all its losses in the same stretch, but other major markets in Europe and Asia have yet to bounce back.Advertisement“The worries around Brexit are now moving from short-term worries to long-term worries, and that’s why we’re seeing this dramatic rebound in the market,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.AdvertisementThe S.&P. 500 index rose 34.68 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,070.
