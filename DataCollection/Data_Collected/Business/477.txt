LONDON — HSBC is requiring contractors in its investment banking business to take a 10 percent pay cut and two weeks of unpaid leave, the latest effort by the lender to cut costs.The bank announced in June that it would shed 50,000 jobs, sell several underperforming businesses and shrink its global investment banking business as it tries to cut billions of dollars in costs.HSBC is also increasing its investment in Asia, where it generates more than half of its earnings.The pay reduction is expected to affect hundreds of contractors in the company’s global banking and markets division, including financial analysts and information technology workers, according to a person with knowledge of the moves.“As a routine practice in Global Banking & Markets, we regularly review rates for contractors to ensure alignment with the market and manage costs,” HSBC said on Thursday.The Times of London first reported the cutbacks in contractor pay on Thursday.HSBC is looking to cut its annual costs by $5 billion by the end of 2017, and it is in the process of selling or exiting underperforming businesses.For example, the bank said in August that it would sell its Brazilian business to Banco Bradesco for $5.2 billion and redeploy capital to Asia and other markets where it has more scale and greater profit potential.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
