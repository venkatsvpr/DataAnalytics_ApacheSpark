But the debate preceding the vote was particularly vehement, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had to intervene to secure the support of two coalition lawmakers.The transfer of the assets, including major organizations such as the country’s power corporation and the water boards of Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, is one of a raft of measures demanded by Greece’s creditors in exchange for bailout funding worth 2.8 billion euros.The government is aiming to secure the money at the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on Oct. 10. Mr. Tsipras has said he hopes the conclusion of the next review of Greece’s finances by creditors will pave the way for talks on relieving Greece’s huge debt.Mr. Tsipras’s increasingly unpopular government is hoping that the beginning of debt negotiations will raise its political fortunes. The International Monetary Fund is insisting on debt relief before the fund will join the country’s third international bailout, worth 86 billion euros, which eurozone leaders agreed to last year.A succession of Greek governments have enforced a barrage of austerity measures, chiefly pension cuts and tax increases, over the last six years in exchange for three bailouts worth more than 300 billion euros. The era of belt-tightening has reduced the country’s huge deficits but also slashed its economy by 25 percent and left one in four Greeks unemployed.Advertisement
