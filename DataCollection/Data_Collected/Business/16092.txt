A one-click payment system for the entire internet.The new global standard will:• Provide a uniform way for users to put their details and payment systems into any web browser.• Be equally open to any existing card or app, so that Bitcoin or Chinese payment providers, already an eco system of their own, can also be included.The project will, however, be a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, both of which did not participate in this project.One thing’s for sure: With so many organizations scrambling to smooth the payment process, you’ll have no excuse for buying too many of the same thing next time you reach the checkout.With the first presidential debate just hours away, Hillary Clinton still faces doubts about the sincerity of her proposals to rein in Wall Street behavior.An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in June found that 60 percent of registered voters expressed concern that her links to major financial companies could prevent her from holding the industry accountable.Mrs. Clinton rejects the notion that her loyalties are in question.Still, the roots of the relationship between the Clintons and Goldman Sachs date to the 1990s. And even as the bank became a whipping boy for politicians looking to lay blame for the crash, both Hillary and Bill Clinton drew the company in closer.Over more than 20 years, Goldman has provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation’s charitable programs.
