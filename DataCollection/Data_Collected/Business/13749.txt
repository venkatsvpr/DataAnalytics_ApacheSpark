The government still owns about 73 percent of the bank.“Following careful examination of all the evidence seen to date, Crown counsel have decided that there is insufficient evidence in law of criminal conduct either in relation to R.B.S. as an institution or any directors or other senior management involved in the rights issue,” the Crown Office said in a news release on Thursday.The Crown Office described the inquiry as “extremely complex,” saying it had included the examination of more than 160,000 documents by a team of specialist forensic accountants and banking experts.“If there were such evidence, those responsible would face prosecution,” the Crown Office said. “If not, the public in Scotland could be reassured that the matter had been properly investigated.”The prosecutor said that it had worked with a variety of organizations in its investigation, including the United States Federal Reserve and two British regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.R.B.S. continues to face legal actions by shareholders in Britain over the rights issue.The lender has not reported a full-year profit since 2007, and its losses widened in the first quarter of 2016 after it made a payment of £1.19 billion to the British government to fulfill a condition of its bailout package.R.B.S. is in the middle of a large restructuring as it shifts away from being a lender with global ambitions to focus on retail and corporate banking in Britain and Ireland. It announced plans last year to dismantle its global investment bank and to significantly reduce the number of countries in which it operates.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
