Michelle Obama, the organization’s honorary president, enhanced its visibility when she hosted a scout campout last year on the South Lawn of the White House. But the venerable organization, about to celebrate its 105th anniversary, is being buffeted by slipping membership numbers, especially among middle-school girls, who can lose interest because of sports, homework and social media.With parents often busy, traditional volunteers also are scarcer. Other girls have left scouting because they wanted more focus on traditional outdoor activities and less on sales of Thin Mints and Samoas.To counter any perception that scouting is out of date, the Girl Scouts are introducing a new marketing campaign that highlights their GIRL initiative — it stands for go-getters, innovators, risk takers and leaders — to better define what it has to offer, according to Sylvia Acevedo, the interim chief executive of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the group’s national body.“We are trying to galvanize our conversation with girls and let them know we are the premier leadership organization for them,” she said.Six years ago, the organization revamped its image for the first time in decades. Old-fashioned badges became less important than experiences, particularly annual cookie sales, which were heralded as teaching money management and other business skills. The cookie program is too vital to Girl Scout finances — it brings in some $800 million in annual sales — to be abandoned, but, with a continuing slide in members, planning began more than a year ago to clarify and broaden the organization’s appeal.The new approach includes a peppy contemporary Girl Scout anthem, a public service announcement highlighting the kinds of roles that girls might take on, a digital fund-raising effort targeting small donors and a national gathering to expose more people to the organization.Ms. Acevedo said that the Girl Scouts would also partner with some community-based organizations. The first such partnership is expected to be announced early next year, and it is seen as crucial because of low membership among growing minority populations. Currently the Girl Scouts have 1.8 million members, a drop from 2.1 million three years ago. About two-thirds of scouts are white, according to Girl Scout figures.In an attempt to broaden the organization’s appeal, the Girl Scouts will host a gathering in Columbus, Ohio, in October that will be open to Girl Scouts and to nonmembers. The event, called GIRL 2017, will give girls opportunities to learn about subjects like therapy animals and hear from entrepreneurs about their experiences building businesses.The new approach can entail some risk.“It can be a big mistake to dilute a brand,” said Americus Reed, professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.“Some are attracted because the DNA in a brand like Girl Scouts comes from gender stereotype roles, but others find that a turnoff because they want something more progressive, like coding, for their daughters,” said Mr. Reed, who studies how people identify with, and become loyal to, brands or products.As part of their new marketing campaign, the Girl Scouts issued an “I’m Prepared … to Lead Like a Girl Scout” public service announcement that is airing nationwide. The 30-second spot, in which girls — none of whom are in scouting uniforms — try a variety of activities including playing the guitar and skateboarding, is also on the Girl Scout YouTube channel, its website and its social media accounts.The spot is set to “Watch Me Shine,” a song written for the Girl Scouts by Liz Rose, a Grammy winner, and Emily Shackleton, who sings lead. The anthem, which will be used at official Girl Scout events, is also available on iTunes, Google Play and Amazon music, with part of the proceeds going to the Girl Scouts organization. The point is to appeal to girls in middle school, the age at which scouting can sometimes lose its appeal.“When you are 13 or 14, you may not know about the opportunities you can have in scouting and the chance to see older girls be leaders,” Sarah Greichen, 17, of Centennial, Colo., said.“Girl Scouts has really transformed me,” added Ms. Greichen, who started scouts as a 7-year-old Brownie.“I didn’t know how to make a phone call to an adult, how to write a business letter or how to speak publicly,” she said, “but I learned when I created my organization, called Score a Friend; I had to talk to parents, teachers, administrators and school district heads.”The organization, inspired by her autistic twin brother, has clubs, and a website, to promote inclusiveness by helping students connect with others and make new friends.While Girl Scouts promote the idea that girls should enroll from kindergarten through high school, some in the organization promote some flexibility. Janet Frasier, chief executive of the Girl Scouts of Utah, said the branding overhaul emphasized the scouts’ “brand essence, which helps us connect more with girls.”But, as a mother of three teenage girls, Ms. Frasier said that while precollege academic commitments can lead some teenagers to drop scouting, she felt that “we need to show that Girl Scouts is a way that girls can differentiate themselves on the competitive road to higher education.”“But even if girls stay only seven or eight years,” she added, “Girl Scouts has provided a foundation for their future.”Advertisement
