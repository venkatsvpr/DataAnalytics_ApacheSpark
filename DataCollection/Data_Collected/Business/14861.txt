They say Uber drivers breach regulations that drivers for taxi firms must follow.Uber says more than 160,000 people use its services in Budapest. The company says that its 1,200 drivers now risk losing their licenses for up to three years despite being professionally licensed and tax compliant.“It is not a ban,” Mr. Khazzam said. “Uber has not been banned in Budapest; it is simply a forced suspension. We have been left no other alternative by the authorities in Hungary in response to these developments.”Mr. Khazzam said Uber hoped to be able to restore its service in Hungary.Advertisement
