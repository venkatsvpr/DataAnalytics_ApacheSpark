The fight for control of Viacom is settled, but the drama over its future is far from over.Thomas E. Dooley will step down as interim chief executive of Viacom in November, the company announced on Wednesday, setting off a search for a permanent leader of the beleaguered entertainment conglomerate that includes the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio.Mr. Dooley, who started at Viacom in 1980 and was a longstanding partner to Viacom’s recently ousted chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, stands to receive $62.4 million upon his departure, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. Mr. Dauman departed the company this month with a total severance package valued at about $72 million.Viacom’s board announced a series of initiatives on Wednesday intended to “improve the company’s financial flexibility” and to position the company for future growth. That includes cutting its dividend and initiating plans to gain access to debt markets to provide greater financial flexibility.Viacom also announced that it was no longer exploring the sale of a minority stake in Paramount, an issue that emerged as one of the central factors in the fight for control of the company. Mr. Dauman had advocated such a deal, while Sumner M. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, opposed it. The company said that the decision preserved other strategic options for the company.Advertisement“While there is more work to do, the actions announced today are an important first step towards realizing the value of Viacom’s exceptional assets and positioning the company for the future,” Ms. Redstone said in a statement.The continued shake-up at Viacom follows a turbulent four months for the company, one of the crown jewels in Mr. Redstone’s $40 billion media empire. A fierce battle over his companies erupted in May, pitting Mr. Redstone, who is 93 and in poor health, and his daughter against his longtime confidants and Viacom directors. Through a private theater chain company, National Amusements, founded by his father, Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS.AdvertisementThe two sides reached a settlement in August, leading to the dismissal of Mr. Dauman, the appointment of Mr. Dooley as interim chief and the remaking of Viacom’s board. While Mr. Dooley initially wanted the top job, he realized he might not get it and was willing to step aside in the best interests of the company, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking.“As I am sure you can imagine, this was an extremely difficult decision,” Mr. Dooley said on Wednesday in a memo to staff members. “I have called Viacom home for 36 years.”The search for a new chief executive will include internal and external candidates. Mr. Dooley will leave on Nov. 15.Viacom’s new board met multiple times over the last month, including two days last week, to evaluate its current operations and chart a new strategic and financial plan. The company also hired the banks Morgan Stanley and LionTree to evaluate its capital structure.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.            There is no question that Viacom is in dire straits. The company has reported persistent declines in profits and revenue and its share price has plummeted more than 50 percent in the last two years. Its television networks have struggled to hold on to viewers and adapt to the digital age. Paramount Pictures has delivered disappointment after disappointment at the box office.On Wednesday, Viacom disclosed that its profit for the quarter ending Sept. 30 would fall well below Wall Street expectations yet again. The company said that its adjusted earnings per share for the quarter would be about 65 to 70 cents; analysts had expected about 98 cents.AdvertisementThe company attributed its revised financial expectations, in part, to writing down a $115 million charge at Paramount related to the expected performance of a yet-to-be-released film.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the finished movie, directed by Chris Wedge, whose credits include “Ice Age,” ended up much more narrow in appeal. Paramount now expects young children as the primary audience when it is released in mid-January.Still, many questions about Viacom’s future remain, including who will take on the top job, how the company will revive its fortunes and whether it will pursue more deal making.“It is obvious that Sumner feels comfortable that Shari should not do anything to sell Viacom,” Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS, said in an interview. “If she is not going to sell, how do you fix it up in an accelerated way?”Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on September 22, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Chief’s Job Soon to Be Open Again at Viacom.
