PARIS — BNP Paribas, the largest French bank, said on Tuesday that its profit rose in the first three months of the year, even as revenue fell in “a particularly unfavorable environment.”The lender, based in Paris, said net income came in at 1.8 billion euros, or $2.1 billion, up 10 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. The results were bolstered by a 28 percent reduction in the funds it set aside for loan losses. Without those one-time adjustments, it said, net income would have been just 4 percent higher, at €1.6 billion.That surprised the market consensus, which had been for a decline in profit.Revenue fell 2 percent from a year earlier, to €10.8 billion.
                It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.            Ultralow interest rates in Europe — led by the European Central Bank’s negative rates policy, weakness in stock markets and unease in the bond market — hurt performance, the bank said. That was most evident at BNP Paribas’s investment banking unit. The unit’s global markets division posted a 24 percent drop in revenue, to €1.3 billion.AdvertisementThe bank last month said it was restructuring the investment banking business, laying off more than 650 employees.AdvertisementJean-Laurent Bonnafé, the bank’s chief executive, said in a news release that the results showed BNP Paribas’s revenue had “held up well thanks to the diversity of its geographies and businesses.”“The operating expenses are well contained and the cost of risk is down significantly,” he added.BNP Paribas said its Basel 3 common equity Tier 1 ratio continued to improve, reaching 11 percent at the end of March, up 10 basis points from its level at the end of 2015. The ratio is an indicator of the bank’s ability to withstand financial stress.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
