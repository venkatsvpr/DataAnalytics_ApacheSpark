As it stands, such measures apply only to long-acting drugs that release their ingredients over 12 hours or more, like OxyContin.The F.D.A. is not required to follow the advice of its panelists, though it often does.It is the second time since 2010 that an F.D.A. panel has recommended expanding safety measures for painkillers. But the training plans instituted about four years ago are voluntary, and data shows that under half of the doctors targeted by the effort have completed the training.Despite a full day of presentations, many panelists said they still could not determine whether the risk plans had helped curb misuse and abuse of the drugs.While overall painkiller prescriptions have fallen slightly over the last five years, that trend began before the safety programs were in effect. At the same time, overdose deaths tracked by federal scientists have continued to rise.“The data does not give us a clear indication of whether we are reaching the target population for the crisis we are trying to resolve,” said Joseph O’Brien, the panel’s patient representative.Advertisement
