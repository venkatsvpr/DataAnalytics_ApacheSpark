The transaction is expected to face significant regulatory review in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.For Asahi, the transaction would expand its presence globally and give it a broader distribution network for its domestic brands, namely Asahi Super Dry. Asahi and its Japanese rivals have moved in recent years to expand beyond their home market as sales have stagnated there.SABMiller said Wednesday that the binding offer would apply to the brands and operations of Royal Dutch Grolsch, Birra Peroni, Miller Brands U.K., the Meantime Brewing Company and SABMiller’s sales and marketing office in France. SABMiller bought Meantime in May.“Through this proposed acquisition, Asahi aims to expand its growth platform in Europe and become a global player with a distinct position,” Asahi said in a news release.In December, Anheuser-Busch InBev first said it was exploring the sale of several of SABMiller’s premium brands in Europe, including Peroni and Grolsch.It was the second move by Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller to appease regulators ahead of their deal, which is expected to close in the second half of this year.In November, SABMiller agreed to sell its 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to its joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch InBev.Both the MillerCoors and Asahi transactions would be contingent on regulators signing off on the larger merger. The deal would not include the rights for the Peroni and Grolsch brands in the United States; those rights belong to MillerCoors.Analysts have also indicated that regulatory pressures in China may push SABMiller to sell its 49 percent stake in a joint venture that owns Snow, China’s best-selling beer brand.Anheuser-Busch InBev is the third-largest brewer in China, behind CR Snow, SABMiller’s joint venture, and Tsingtao Brewery, but it would become the country’s largest brewer by market share if it is allowed to keep the stake.China Resources Enterprise, SABMiller’s joint venture partner, would be a likely buyer in the event of a sale, analysts said.Japanese drinks companies have been on an acquisition spree overseas over the last decade as they seek to make up for falling sales at home, where consumption has been in persistent decline because the population is shrinking and aging.The deal would be the largest transaction for Asahi, which bought a 20 percent stake in the Chinese brewer Tsingtao in 2009, paying $667 million, and has taken over smaller alcohol and soft drinks businesses in Malaysia, New Zealand and elsewhere.Its traditional rivals in Japan have been expanding even more aggressively, however.Kirin, the country’s second-largest brewer, has acquired or bought large stakes in several foreign beverage groups, including San Miguel of the Philippines, Nathan Lion of Australia and Schincariol of Brazil. In 2014, Suntory paid $13.6 billion for the American distiller of Jim Beam, Maker’s Mark and other liquor brands.Asahi, based in Toyko, began its operations in 1889 as the Osaka Beer Brewing Company. Its brands include the Japanese beers Asahi Super Dry and Premium Beer Jukusen, as well as the Japanese whiskeys Pure Malt Taketsuru, Single Malt Yoichi and Nikka. It also is the distributor for Bass Pale Ale, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois in Japan.In addition to its alcoholic beverage businesses, Asahi manufactures food and soft drinks and operates a variety of restaurants in Japan. The company posted revenue of 1.86 trillion Japanese yen, or about $16.1 billion, in 2015.Asahi accounted for about 1.2 percent of global beer sales in 2014, making it the 10th largest brewer worldwide, according to the research firm Euromonitor International.By comparison, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, accounted for 20.7 percent of global beer sales in 2014, followed by SABMiller with 9.70 percent of worldwide sales, according to Euromonitor.Lazard and Deutsche Bank and the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer are advising Anheuser-Busch InBev on the Asahi transaction.
