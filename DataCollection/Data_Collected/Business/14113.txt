Fnac offered to pay 914 million pounds, or about $1.3 billion, in cash for Darty, or 170 pence a share.Darty’s board had previously recommended that shareholders accept an earlier offer from Conforama, but it withdrew the recommendation in favor of Fnac’s higher bid.“The Darty directors consider that the final offer is in the best interests of Darty shareholders as a whole,” the company said in a news release on Tuesday.Fnac offered to pay £558 million for Darty in November, and Steinhoff made a higher offer in March.At the time of its offer, Steinhoff abandoned its pursuit of the Home Retail Group, as it faced a separate and potentially lengthy battle with the British grocery chain J Sainsbury.The bidding for Darty heated up when a series of escalating offers by Conforama and Fnac on April 21 sent shares of Darty up 23 percent in trading in London.Conforama’s highest offer was 160 pence a share, or about £860 million, in cash.Shares of Darty were down slightly to 167.90 pence Tuesday morning.Darty operates about 400 stores in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It reported revenue of more than 3.5 billion euros, or about $3.9 billion, in its 2014-15 financial year.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
