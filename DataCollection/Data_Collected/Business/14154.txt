The Justice Department announced criminal charges on Thursday against two former Deutsche Bank traders accused of manipulating interest rates, the latest Wall Street employees to be ensnared in the government’s wide-ranging crackdown.The former traders, Matthew Connolly and Gavin Campbell Black, were indicted on charges that they manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark rate that underpins trillions of dollars in mortgages, student loans and other debt.Mr. Connolly, who was taken into custody on Thursday, is the first American citizen to be charged in the Libor case.Before leaving Deutsche Bank — Germany’s largest financial institution — both defendants were senior traders there. Mr. Connolly was the director of a trading desk in New York that worked with financial products based on Libor, while Mr. Black was a director on a Deutsche Bank trading desk in London.AdvertisementThe case against the former traders, coming more than a year after Deutsche Bank resolved its role in the scheme, represents an escalation of the Justice Department’s long-running investigation into Libor manipulation. The investigation has already led to criminal cases against six banks, including Barclays and UBS.AdvertisementWhen Deutsche Bank settled the charges against it last year, it agreed to pay $2.5 billion in regulatory and criminal penalties, a record for the Libor cases. Deutsche Bank also agreed to accept a criminal guilty plea for the British subsidiary at the center of the case.The Libor case announced on Thursday is unusual in that it also includes charges against individual bank employees. In the wake of the financial crisis, banks paid billions of dollars in fines, but none of their top executives went to prison, stoking criticism of the Justice Department’s approach to Wall Street wrongdoing.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            In contrast, the Justice Department charged 13 individuals linked to Libor manipulation. Three pleaded guilty, two were convicted at trial, and the remaining cases are ongoing.“Millions of people around the world rely on Libor and other global financial benchmarks as accurate and honestly reported rates,” Leslie R. Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington, which is leading the criminal Libor investigation, said in a statement. “Manipulation of these rates undermines the integrity of our financial system, and the Justice Department will continue to hold accountable both the financial institutions and the individuals responsible for this conduct.”Mr. Connolly and Mr. Black, who face wire fraud charges, are not the only Deutsche Bank traders charged in the case. Michael Curtler, another former Deutsche Bank trader in London, pleaded guilty in October 2015 and is most likely cooperating with the government.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The trading commission is a civil regulatory agency in Washington, but the Justice Department handled the criminal component of the case.AdvertisementThe investigation centered on the panel of banks that made daily submissions to help set Libor, an average of how much those banks said they would pay to borrow from one another. As a benchmark for trillions of dollars in financial products, Libor is a cornerstone of the financial marketplace.Deutsche Bank and its traders, the Justice Department said, would submit “false and fraudulent Libor contributions” to benefit their own trading positions, carrying out the scheme from around 2005 to 2011. They made these submissions, the Justice Department said, “rather than the honest and unbiased costs of borrowing.”The challenge will be proving that the former traders knew the submissions were false. In a 2007 email, Mr. Connolly notified one of the Libor submitters that, “if possible, we need” Libor “as low as possible next few days.” The submitter promised to “do our best.”A version of this article appears in print on June 3, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Libor-Rigging Case Snares Former Traders From Deutsche Bank.
