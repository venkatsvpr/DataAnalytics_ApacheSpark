The final installment of the 2012 mini-series “Hatfields and McCoys” drew more than 14 million viewers and nearly 10 million people tuned in for the premiere of the 2013 mini-series “Bonnie & Clyde,” which, like “Roots,” was broadcast on A&E, History and Lifetime simultaneously.The “Roots” revival received strong reviews, but it had a formidable opponent: Game 7 of the N.B.A. Western Conference finals. The game between the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder had nearly 16 million viewers, a record breaker for a professional basketball game on cable.The final three installments for “Roots” will be broadcast Tuesday through Thursday.Advertisement
