LONDON — Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that it had lost money in the first quarter as turbulence hurt its global markets and investment banking business.Tidjane Thiam, who joined Credit Suisse as chief executive in July, is in the middle of an extensive  overhaul of the Swiss bank, shrinking its investment bank and placing greater emphasis on its wealth-management business, particularly in Asia and other emerging markets.Mr. Thiam announced an acceleration of those efforts in March after he said that top executives had been surprised by the size of large, risky positions in the bank’s trading book.The lender’s turnaround has not been helped by turmoil in the financial markets, which have cut into results across the industry and sent Credit Suisse last year to its first annual loss since 2008.AdvertisementIn the first three months of the year, Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, reported a loss of 302 million Swiss francs, or about $311 million. The bank reported a profit of 1.05 billion francs in the first quarter of 2015.AdvertisementThe Swiss bank reported a loss of 484 million francs before taxes, beating analysts’ expectations.“In the first three months of the year, we have remained focused on executing our strategy with three clear priorities: accelerating our cost and head count reduction efforts, delivering profitable growth in wealth-management-focused divisions and maintaining our strong capital position,” Mr. Thiam said in a news release. “We have been able to make good progress in all of these areas against an extremely challenging market backdrop.”Revenue declined 30 percent, to 4.64 billion francs, in the first quarter, from 6.65 billion francs in the same period a year earlier.The bank’s global markets and investment banking businesses both showed pretax losses in the quarter, as the lender navigated “some of the most difficult markets on record” and trading volumes and client activity were “drastically reduced,” Mr. Thiam said.“While we saw tentative signs of a pickup in activity in March and then in April, subdued market conditions and low levels of client activity are likely to persist in the second quarter of 2016 and possibly beyond,” he said.The global markets business reported a pretax loss of 635 million francs in the first quarter, compared with a pretax profit of 842 million francs in the same period a year earlier.The investment banking and capital markets business reported a pretax loss of 103 million francs in the quarter, from a pretax loss of 47 million francs in the first quarter of 2015.As part of its reshaping, Credit Suisse is trying to reduce the company’s annual net costs by 1.4 billion francs this year. It achieved more than half of those cuts during the quarter, Mr. Thiam said. The bank is aiming for overall cost cuts of 4.3 billion Swiss francs by the end of 2018.AdvertisementThe bank has already made about 3,500 of 6,000 expected job cuts this year, Mr. Thiam said. The bank employed 47,760 people at the end of the first quarter.Over all, operating expenses declined 3 percent, to 4.97 billion francs, in the quarter, from 5.11 billion francs in the first quarter of 2015. Credit Suisse also took restructuring charges of 255 million francs in the first quarter.
                It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.            Despite the challenging environment, Mr. Thiam said that the company’s businesses focused on wealth management performed “strongly” in the quarter.The bank’s international wealth management business reported a pretax profit of 270 million francs in the quarter, compared with 263 million francs in the first quarter of 2015.Credit Suisse’s Asia-Pacific business reported a pretax profit of 251 million francs in the first quarter, from 465 million francs in the same period a year earlier.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
