LONDON — Barclays said on Wednesday that it planned to sell a 12.2 percent stake in the Barclays Africa Group as it moves to reduce its holdings in the business in an accelerated strategy shift led by its new chief executive.The British bank announced plans in March to sell down its 62.3 percent stake in the African business over the next two to three years, and James E. Staley, its chief executive, said the action announced Wednesday was “an important first step.”Barclays, which has operated in the region for more than a century, wants to reduce its holdings in the African business to below a controlling level or sell the stake entirely. The goal is to free Barclays from regulatory and capital requirements that have dragged on its balance sheet.“We continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options,” said Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, in a news release.AdvertisementThe Barclays African business is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and holds majority stakes in banks in 10 countries, with offices in two others. The business’s biggest profit driver is South Africa.James Staley, chief executive of the British bank, said that cutting Barclay's stake in its African business and its dividend were very painful, but necessary decisions.The African business was considered one of four pillars of Barclays’s strategy, alongside its credit card and its consumer and investment banking operations, under Antony Jenkins, who was ousted as chief executive in July.AdvertisementUnder Mr. Staley, the bank is accelerating the sale of businesses it does not consider core operations and focusing its strategy around two divisions: the British consumer bank, and the corporate and investment bank.Barclays said it would sell 103.6 million shares, or 12.2 percent of the business, in a private offering to institutional investors.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
