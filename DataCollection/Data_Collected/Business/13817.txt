Advisers in UBS’s American wealth management division will use a robot to cater to well-heeled clients.The company’s 7,000 advisers will begin using technology developed by a San Francisco start-up, SigFig Wealth Management, one of a growing group of so-called robo-advisers that are shaking up the brokerage business with low-cost, automated investing.UBS is also taking an undisclosed equity stake in SigFig and will develop investing technology alongside it. The two are expected to announce the moves on Monday morning.For UBS, bringing in SigFig’s technology is meant to bolster production as the industry faces competitive pressures. In the first quarter, UBS’s average financial adviser had $147 million of invested assets and $1.06 million in revenue.AdvertisementThe technology will allow the advisers to spend more time talking to clients and less time constructing investment portfolios and other activities that lend themselves to automation, said Tom Naratil, the president of UBS Americas.Advertisement“It’ll make them more effective in helping clients to make better choices,” he said.But unlike some other brokerage firms, which are developing products for retail customers, UBS will not take a robo-adviser service directly to its wealthy customers, Mr. Naratil said in an interview.“We’ll give them some tools, but we’re not going down the self-serve route,” he said.The mainstream wealth management industry has been scrambling to respond to the popularity of robo-investing, in which digital services sort people into portfolios of exchange-traded funds based on their answers to online questionnaires, and then automatically maintain those portfolios.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch is expected to introduce such a service, and executives from Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have talked about developing or acquiring the capability. Charles Schwab rolled out its robo-service last year, and even the fund giant Vanguard developed a sort of robo-hybrid advisory business.SigFig, led by Mike Sha, was one of the earlier firms in the field but has not gained the sort of household attention that companies like Wealthfront and Betterment have achieved by focusing on younger, tech-aware retail customers.Instead, SigFig is focused on offering its technology through financial institutions. The agreement with UBS will not prevent SigFig from forging similar agreements with other companies, said Mr. Sha, the company’s chief executive.New rules for financial advisers may give the automated companies an edge in the battle for investor dollars.These rules are expected to encourage a rush of retirement savings money to low-cost investments and may also hasten formal alliances of banks or brokerage firms with the financial technology firms that have built robo-investing platforms.Last month, SigFig announced its first agreement with a bank, the $3.2 billion Cambridge Savings Bank outside Boston.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
