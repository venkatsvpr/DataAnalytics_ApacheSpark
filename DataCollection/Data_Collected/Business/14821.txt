LONDON — The London Stock Exchange Group and the Deutsche Börse said on Monday that they would lower the acceptance threshold required from shareholders in the German exchange operator for their merger to proceed.The exchanges also said they would extend by two weeks the period for investors in the German exchange to accept the offer to exchange their Deutsche Börse stock for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity. The offer period will now expire on July 26. It was originally set to expire on Tuesday.Last week, shareholders in the London exchange overwhelmingly approved the all-stock deal, which the stock exchange operators hope will create a European champion in the industry.But a vote by Britons to leave the European Union has raised questions about whether the merger could be completed under its current terms, and in particular whether the combined entity’s holding company should be based in Britain, as planned.AdvertisementSome German investors have called for the companies to re-evaluate their plans and to move the holding company’s base elsewhere in the European Union. The head of BaFin, the German financial regulator, has also questioned whether the combined business could be based in the European Union given the outcome of the referendum.AdvertisementThe merger agreement had originally called for at least 75 percent of Deutsche Börse’s outstanding shares to be tendered in the offer, but the companies agreed to lower the threshold to 60 percent on Monday.By lowering the threshold, they have made it easier for index funds to participate in the offering, the companies said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
