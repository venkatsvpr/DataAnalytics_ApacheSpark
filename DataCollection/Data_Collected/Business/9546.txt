Previously the Federal Aviation Administration had urged passengers to turn off and not charge the phones aboard planes.Samsung said in a news release that the reduction in profits tied to that decision was expected to be in the mid-2 trillion won range in the October-December period and about 1 trillion won, or $900 million, for the first quarter of next year.Since its decision to recall millions of Note 7 devices and end production of the model, Samsung has been readjusting profit estimates. On Wednesday, it revised its previously estimated profit of 7.8 trillion won for the third quarter, cutting it to 5.2 trillion won.With the Note 7, Samsung had hoped to compete with Apple’s iPhones in the high-end smartphone market. But after some of the Note 7s were reported to heat rapidly and catch fire, it faced one of the biggest and most costly product recalls in the technology industry.“Moving forward, Samsung Electronics plans to normalize its mobile business by expanding sales of flagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge,” the company said in a statement. “Additionally, the company will focus on enhancing product safety for consumers by making significant changes in its quality assurance processes.”Advertisement
