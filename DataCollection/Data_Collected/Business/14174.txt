“Waiting in Line for the Illusion of Security,” (The Upshot, Economic View, May 29) by Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard and Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago, looked at the long lines at Transportation Security Administration airport checkpoints as an economic problem.The article received 267 comments.As usual, the economists miss the political forest for the economic trees. What the T.S.A. screens for is a political decision, and the budget they are provided is a political decision. The simplest solution to long lines: Hire more T.S.A. inspectors.DWR, Los AngelesMr. Mullainathan and Mr. Thaler state: “We have no way of knowing whether the current procedures are optimal.” But we do. The T.S.A. regularly conducts screening tests, attempting to bring contraband through checkpoints. Reportedly, in 95 percent of the tests, T.S.A. checkpoint agents fail to detect prohibited items brought in by other T.S.A. agents.The traveling public deserves a less expensive, more efficient process. What are we waiting for?Boston Barry, Framingham, Mass.AdvertisementThe crowds that are created by the T.S.A. are perfect launching platforms for suicide bombers. Why should they wait to get to the screeners?Thomas Speer, TucsonLet’s take a look at the “costs” in the system imposed by the airlines’ continuation of baggage fees, which is the unnamed culprit here.
