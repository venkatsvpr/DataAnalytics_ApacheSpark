It has been in development for three years and recently started a pilot in stores in Columbus, Ohio.With the backing of many of the largest U.S. retailers, CurrentC had been seen as one of several promising entrants in the crowded mobile payments space, and a rival to Apple Pay. In October, MCX signed a deal with JPMorgan Chase to accept payment through the bank’s technology.Also Monday, Walmart activated its own mobile payment system, unveiled late last year, in nearly 600 stores in Texas and Arkansas.Advertisement
