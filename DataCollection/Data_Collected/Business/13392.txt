Since then, the company has pursued a dual-track effort to separate the lighting division through either a public offering or a private sale.As part of its first-quarter results on Monday, Philips said that improving markets had increased the possibility of its pursuing a public listing for the business.“With equity markets’ sentiment improving compared to the first couple of months of the year, an I.P.O. increasingly appears a more likely outcome, subject to further market developments and other relevant circumstances,” Philips said in a news release. “However, the company has not yet concluded on all proposals in the private sale process and continues to assess the attractiveness of this route compared to the I.P.O.”Philips said that it expected to update the market on its plans “shortly.”The lighting business includes divisions that produce traditional light bulbs and that design complete lighting systems. The business had about 34,000 employees and posted sales of 7.4 billion euros, or about $8.3 billion, in 2015.On Monday, Philips also said that it was “actively engaging” with interested parties about the sale of its automotive and LED components business, Lumileds.In January, Philips called off the sale of a controlling stake in that business to GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners, because of regulatory concerns raised in the United States.Over all, Philips reported a profit of €37 million in the first quarter, from €100 million in the first three months of 2015. The company had sales of €5.5 billion in the first quarter, from €5.3 billion in the prior-year period.The first quarter included charges of €52 million related to the separation of the lighting business. Philips said that it expected to record costs of €200 million to €225 million related to the separation of the lighting business this year.Advertisement
