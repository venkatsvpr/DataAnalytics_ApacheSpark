That was down from €1.72 billion in the first quarter of 2015.On a currency-neutral basis, profit rose 8 percent in the quarter, Santander said.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, fell 6 percent to €7.62 billion in the first quarter, from €8.04 billion in the same period a year earlier.“Our Q1 results are ahead of plan, and we continue to deliver on all of our commitments,” Ana Patricia Botín, the Santander chairwoman, said in a news release.The profit in the bank’s British unit fell 4 percent to €453 million in the quarter, from €471 million in the first quarter of 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, it was down less than 1 percent, Santander said.Britain is an important market for Santander, one of Europe’s largest banks. During the first quarter, the pound weakened against the euro amid uncertainty in Britain, which will hold a referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the European Union.The pound has strengthened in recent days, reaching a 10-week high against the dollar on Tuesday, but its value is expected to continue to fluctuate before the vote.Weaker currencies in Latin America also weighed on Santander’s results, sending profit in its businesses there down 16 percent in the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, profit rose 8 percent in Latin America.Profit fell 25 percent in Brazil to €359 million in the first quarter, from €477 million in the same period a year earlier.Over all, provisions for delinquent and defaulted loans were down 6 percent, to €2.41 billion, in the quarter, from €2.56 billion in the first quarter of 2015.Operating expenses declined 4 percent to €5.16 billion in the first quarter, from €5.38 billion in the same period a year earlier.Santander’s earnings in Spain, its home market, fell 10 percent to €307 million in the quarter, from €340 million in the first quarter of 2015.Advertisement
