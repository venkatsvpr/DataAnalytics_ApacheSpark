He was 68.The cause was cancer, his wife, Karen Warner Kurtzman, said.While working for the United Nations, Mr. Kurtzman was among the first economists to flag the Latin American debt crisis in the 1990s. He was so habitually wary about business being buffeted by outside forces that he was credited with coining the term “economic headwinds.”Mr. Kurtzman, a former managing senior fellow at the nonpartisan Milken Institute, an economic research firm, wrote, co-wrote or edited more than 20 books, including “The Death of Money,” which forecast the fragility of the digital network that replaced paper currency. Others, like “The Decline and Crash of the American Economy,” were predicated on equally bleak outcomes.But in 2014, in “Unleashing the Second American Century: Four Forces for Economic Dominance,” he largely dispensed with his earlier doomsaying, suggesting instead that the future was bright for a nation poised for energy independence, already leading in innovation, blessed with a surfeit of private capital and supported by a productive and expanding industrial base. “The wind is at our backs,” he wrote.Those four transformational forces make America unique, Mr. Kurtzman asserted. The notion that American manufacturing had fizzled was a fallacy, he said, considering what companies based in the United States produce abroad and what foreign companies make in America.“German, Canadian and French students may throw rocks at the police during anti-globalization demonstrations, but they do it with American rock ’n’ roll or rap on their iPhones and iPods, listening to their music using Beats headphones made by Dr. Dre,” he wrote. “They wear Levi’s jeans and Nike running shoes (the perfect shoes to wear when you’re protesting against America) while digesting Big Macs and fries or Crunchwraps from Taco Bell.“When they get home,” he continued, “they do their homework on Dell or Apple computers and take American medicines to make sure their police-inflicted bruises do not get infected. They do this while the police, who try to stop the demonstrations, talk on Motorola emergency radios, fly American-made helicopters, and — if need be — spray American-made pepper and tear gas to clear the gatherings.”Joel Allen Kurtzman was born in Los Angeles on June 25, 1947, the son of Samuel Kurtzman, an immigrant from Russia who became a dentist, and the former Roselle Rosencranz.He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor’s degree in history in 1970 and received a master’s in economic forecasting from the University of Houston-Clear Lake.In addition to his wife, the former Karen Warner Smith, he is survived by a son, Eli; a stepdaughter, Katherine Warner Molek; and a sister, Kaaren Kurtzman.Mr. Kurtzman had the title global lead partner for thought leadership and innovation at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he developed an “opacity index,” which measured the risks of doing business abroad.After working at the United Nations from 1978 to 1987, he was a business editor and columnist for The New York Times from 1987 to 1993; editor in chief of The Harvard Business Review; a partner in Knowledge Universe, a private equity investment firm; founding editor in chief of Strategy & Business magazine (where he coined the term “thought leader”); editor in chief of Korn/Ferry Institute’s Briefings on Talent & Leadership magazine; and a member of the editorial board of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan Management Review.He wrote two novels in the early 1970s before turning to books on economics, including “No More Dying: The Conquest of Aging and the Extension of Human Life” in 1976 and “MBA in a Box: Practical Ideas from the Best Brains in Business,” with Glenn Rifkin, in 2004.Advertisement
