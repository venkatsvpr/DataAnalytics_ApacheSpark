It pays to work for John C. Malone.The billionaire who built a cable and communications empire is 74, and no longer a chief executive himself. But Mr. Malone still exerts sway from various boardrooms, and the C.E.O.s at the companies he oversees are routinely among the best compensated managers on the planet. Last year, the largess was particularly notable.Take Discovery Communications, the cable group behind Shark Week and shows like “Cake Boss.” Mr. Malone spun Discovery out of his media group and still sits on the board. His choice for chief executive, David M. Zaslav, received total compensation worth $156 million last year, making him the highest-paid chief of an American public company, according to the Equilar 200 Highest-Paid CEO Rankings, conducted for The New York Times.Just behind Mr. Zaslav on the list of the highest-paid chief executives is Michael T. Fries of Liberty Global, an international cable and wireless group that Mr. Malone presides over as chairman. And while Mr. Fries made considerably less than Mr. Zaslav — $44 million less — he still got a package worth $112 million.Gregory B. Maffei, one of Mr. Malone’s closest lieutenants, was paid twice in 2014. As chief of Liberty Media, which owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team and a big stake in the satellite radio provider SiriusXM, Mr. Maffei received compensation of $41.3 million. As chief of Liberty Interactive, a related company that owns stakes in home shopping networks, he received $32.4 million. Mr. Malone, the chairman of both companies, awarded his friend a total of $74 million last year, placing him sixth on the list.AdvertisementThomas M. Rutledge, another Malone confidant who oversees the regional cable operator Charter Communications, where Mr. Malone and Mr. Maffei are board members, was given a $16 million package last year, an increase of 259 percent over 2013. Though Mr. Malone is not on the compensation committee that sets executive pay, Mr. Maffei is.AdvertisementTaken together, the four C.E.O.s were awarded more than $350 million last year, occupying three of the top six spots of the study conducted by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm.“At John Malone’s companies, there’s still a great deal of inside baseball in setting executive pay,” said Robert Jackson Jr., a professor of corporate governance at Columbia Law School. “When you think about $350 million among four men, it’s hard to see how that’s what they need to be paid competitively.”All five companies performed well last year, though Discovery’s stock was down, and Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Fries both signed new long-term contracts, accounting for their especially big paydays. Mr. Malone and the four chief executives all declined to comment.Mr. Malone’s disciples were not alone in gorging on the pay equivalent of a chocolate-covered cream-filled Cronut. The leaders of technology companies, financial groups and drug companies all profited handsomely last year, enjoying their seats at the endless feast of executive compensation.
                Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.            At public companies with market values of more than $1 billion and that had filed proxies by April 30, the average package for the top 200 best paid chief executives was worth $22.6 million, trumping last year’s average of $20.7 million, and the median was $17.6 million. Those are the highest amounts since Equilar began keeping track in 2006.All You Can EatToday’s bursting-at-the-seams paydays arrive despite sustained efforts to restrict excessive executive compensation.Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which made certain pay practices more onerous, compensation committees have mostly abandoned several controversial pay mechanisms. Employers are no longer footing the tax bills for departing C.E.O.s who enjoy golden parachutes. Supplemental pension plans, which heaped benefits on executives regardless of how well the company did, are largely a thing of the past. Stock awards are mostly tied to performance, not simply awarded at regular intervals.Advertisement“Fifteen years ago, there were some programs that were egregious,” Gerard Leider of Meridian Compensation Partners said. “Today there is more sensitivity than there ever has been.”Underpinning these efforts was a belief that more transparency would lead to some much needed belt-tightening. If only companies were forced to reveal just how sweet their packages were, perhaps they would reform.“The increased pressure for more disclosure was motivated by public shaming,” said Regina Olshan, head of the executive compensation practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. “The idea was somehow that the companies would be ashamed and change their ways.”It hasn’t worked.“I don’t think those folks are particularly ashamed,” Ms. Olshan said. “ If they are getting paid, they feel they deserve those amounts. And if they are on the board, they feel like they are paying competitively to attract talent.”In theory, the momentum to rein in runaway pay continues. Dodd-Frank introduced new say-on-pay measures, allowing shareholders to express their discontent. The Securities and Exchange Commission is developing rules that would require companies to reveal the ratio of the chief executive’s pay to that of average workers. And last month, the S.E.C. proposed requiring companies to disclose how performance affects executive pay.If companies have to report C.E.O. pay that is 1,000 times that of the average worker or justify growing pay in spite of weak results, perhaps shame will kick in.In the meantime, like an all-you-can-eat buffet for America’s captains of industry, it seems there is no end to how much money executives can devour. For the first time, all 10 of the top-paid C.E.O.s on Equilar’s list received at least $50 million last year.
                There are very few women on the list of top-paid executives — just 13 out of 200 — and their average pay, $20 million, is 11.5 percent less than the $22.6 million overall average.            And while much of the overall compensation came in the form of stock — some of which vests over several years — some chief executives received generous cash bonuses, a form of compensation that does little to incentivize long-term performance.Advertisement“It’s really an outmoded way of paying,” Mr. Jackson said.Leslie Moonves, boss of CBS, took home a $25 million cash bonus last year. Philippe P. Dauman, chief of Viacom, received a $20 million cash bonus. And Robert A. Iger, head of Walt Disney, enjoyed a cash bonus just shy of $23 million. In each case, the bonuses were awarded through a mix of performance-based metrics and discretionary measures and represented about half of the media moguls’ total annual compensation.Yet some cash bonuses seemed to reward simply doing of one’s job. In the case of Mr. Moonves, $12 million of that bonus was tied to the performance of the company, while the remaining $13 million was doled out by the compensation committee partly in special recognition of his “leadership and direction in the creation of premium content.” In other words, the television studio C.E.O. got a big bonus for being a television studio C.E.O.CBS and Viacom declined to comment. A Disney spokesman did not respond directly to a question about Mr. Iger’s bonus, but wrote in an email that “92 percent of Mr. Iger’s annual compensation is performance-based.”Media and technology executives have traditionally been among the best paid on the Equilar list and executives at creative empires now routinely make more than those of big banks and other industries. Among the 13 media companies on the Equilar list, the median C.E.O. salary was more than $40 million.“It’s good to be in media and technology,” Mr. Jackson said. “The financial crisis has focused the government’s attention on banks and financial services, where you used to go to get paid.”Additional tech and media C.E.O.s near the top of the list include Steven M. Mollenkopf of Qualcomm, who made $60.7 million; Marissa A. Mayer of Yahoo, who made $42 million; and Joshua W. Sapan of AMC Networks, who made $40.3 million, rewarded for the success of shows like “Breaking Bad,” “Mad Men” and “The Walking Dead.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Gabelli, founder of the investment firm Gamco, who was awarded $88.5 million, and two more tech executives — the GoPro founder and chief Nicholas Woodman, with $77.4 million in compensation, and Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder and a fixture on top earner lists, who made $67.2 million. Mr. Ellison stepped down as C.E.O. last year; whether he will draw such a big salary in his new role as executive chairman is a question that will be answered in next year’s proxy filing.However large, these pay packages do not represent the pinnacle of executive compensation. Hedge fund and private equity firm leaders can make not just tens of millions of dollars a year, but more than $1 billion.
                The men at the top of the hedge fund universe now run firms that are bigger than they have ever been.            The top 25 hedge fund managers took home a combined $11.62 billion last year, according to Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine, or nearly a half-billion dollars each. The top earner, Kenneth C. Griffin, the founder and chief executive of Citadel, brought home $1.3 billion. Private equity chieftains did nearly as well. Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group made $690 million last year, up from $450 million in 2013. (Hedge funds and private equity firms compensate executives through a mix of fees, carried interest and dividends, which are not calculated in Equilar’s study.)AdvertisementMany of the companies bestowing such kingly packages on their executives have performed well in recent years, enriching ordinary shareholders at the same time. But even experts acknowledge that executive compensation is more art than science.“There are certainly many historical and odd factors that come in to play,” when boards establish pay, Ms. Olshan of Skadden Arps said. “Nobody really knows how much difference a particular C.E.O. will make.”What Goes Into the Mix Just one year ago, it seemed change might be afoot.The French economist Thomas Piketty electrified economic circles with his surprise hit book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” A simmering debate about American inequality boiled over into the mainstream, and calls rang out to narrow the income gap. Say-on-pay votes chastened several companies, including Chipotle Mexican Grill and Domino’s Pizza, prompting them to lower executive pay and tie packages more closely to performance.In recent months, some companies have made efforts to help lower-paid workers. A national movement is urging fast-food chains to raise the minimum wage. Some big companies like McDonald’s, Walmart and Aetna have all announced pay increases for select workers (though none of those three companies reduced executive compensation as a way to narrow the income gap).“Last year was a wake-up call for a lot of companies,” Mr. Pryce-Jones said. “They are trying to say the right thing.”But as the data makes clear, the compensation committees setting pay for the 0.01 percent are anything but humbled. While a couple of chiefs — at Key Energy Services and Park Electrochemical — took voluntary pay cuts in solidarity with workers who also faced wage reductions, there was no broad movement among executives to leave money on the table. Instead, as companies continued their sustained recovery after the financial crisis, C.E.O.s were paid better than ever before.Big pay has its defenders. “What does ‘excessive’ mean?” said Mr. Leider, the compensation consultant who advises companies on pay packages. “What somebody who works on the line considers excessive is different than what someone who has worked in management for 10 years considers excessive.” The defense of these supersize salaries comes down to the idea that the executives, like celebrities, ought to be rewarded for their indispensable contributions. “Movie stars and sports stars get paid a lot for a very unique skill set,” Mr. Leider said. “Some of these C.E.O.s have very unique skill sets.”AdvertisementWhat’s more, the companies say that many pay packages are largely tied to performance, aligning the interests of the chief executive with those of shareholders, and that some headline figures are skewed by the fact that many stock awards vest over time.For example, Satya Nadella, who was named chief of Microsoft in February of last year, was awarded compensation worth $84.3 million in 2014. But most of that is a one-time equity grant that will be distributed over seven years.For a more accurate picture, “the value of equity awards should be annualized over their vesting periods,” a Microsoft spokesman said. By that measure, Mr. Nadella would have earned nearly $22.8 million last year, $29 million from 2015 to 2018, and $26.5 million in 2019 and 2020. Still a handsome payday.Even when companies do try to align pay with performance, critics argue that the efforts are often halfhearted. When stock awards are tied to benchmarks in a company’s share price, the targets are frequently set so low that only a catastrophic failure would prevent a chief executive from reaping the reward, shareholder rights activists say. Aligning pay packages with metrics like earnings per share is not necessarily better, as E.P.S. can be easily manipulated quarter to quarter. And when the broader stock market is rising, a C.E.O. need do little more than not destroy the company to look like a visionary leader.Caterpillar, for example, a company with $52 billion in sales, set a target of just $20 million annual operating profit after capital charge, an obscure measure that calculates earnings after certain costs, for executives to get their payouts. Unsurprisingly, Caterpillar reported an operating profit after capital charge of $1.4 billion, and executives received 167 percent of their target bonuses.Walmart, on the other hand, had a disappointing year, and paid executives less than their target bonuses, with its chief, Doug McMillon, receiving a cash bonus of $2.9 million, or 75 percent of his targeted $3.8 million. Still, critics contend Mr. McMillon is overpaid. “We’re still not seeing enough links between long-term performance and pay,” Mr. Pryce-Jones said.And while one-time grants might make 2014 pay look big for people like Mr. Nadella, some executives receive huge payouts year after year.Take Mr. Moonves of CBS. Over the last four years, he was awarded compensation worth just under $250 million — or a quarter-billion dollars for 48 months work. Mr. Ellison of Oracle fared even better, receiving $319.3 million in awards during that period.AdvertisementAnother C.E.O. reliably near the top: Mr. Zaslav of Discovery Communications.While the package that placed him atop this year’s list reflected a new multiyear employment agreement (as did that of Mr. Fries), Mr. Zaslav has routinely made more than his corner office peers. The chief of Discovery since 2007, he reaped $52.4 million in 2011, $49.3 million in 2012, $33.3 million in 2013 and now $156 million last year, for total compensation of $291 million since 2011.Such sustained lavishness is enabled, in part, by the closely controlled structure of Mr. Malone’s companies. In each case, Mr. Malone and his allies heavily influence voting shares, while ordinary investors typically hold stock with fewer rights.“At John Malone’s companies, shareholders have very few rights,” said Mr. Jackson, the Columbia professor.It’s a common story. Chummy boardrooms, easily achieved performance targets and large discretionary bonuses — these are the hallmarks of executive compensation today. They persist despite decades of attempted reform, the best efforts of shareholder advocates and concern about rising inequality. And as long as compensation is determined by insular groups of board members, there is little chance that the feeding frenzy will end anytime soon.“The inside, clubby mentality of being in the right group at the right time is still the way to get paid at big American companies,” Mr. Jackson said. “Even after say-on-pay, even after disclosure rules, even after the financial crisis, it shows how much work we still have to do.”Because of an editing error, a chart with an article last Sunday about chief executives’ pay misstated the percentage by which average compensation for top-paid female chief executives trailed that of top-paid chief executives over all. It is 11.5 percent, not 9.4 percent.A version of this article appears in print on May 17, 2015, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: It’s (Still) Their Party .
