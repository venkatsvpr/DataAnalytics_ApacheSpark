Suggesting that women on public company boards are voting for C.E.O. pay packages to “fit in” with their board colleagues does not take into account findings by Catalyst, Credit Suisse and McKinsey & Company that when women are on boards, companies deliver better long-term results. This might explain the higher C.E.O. compensation.A more insightful article might have dug deeper into why only eight of the 100 companies cited by Equilar are led by women, or why United States public companies remain slow to add female directors in meaningful numbers, or how few nominating and governance committees are led by women.Nora Aufreiter TorontoLynn Dorsey Bleil Park City, UtahSuzanne Nimocks HoustonStacey Rauch Short Hills, N.J., May 31The writers are all retired senior partners from McKinsey & Company and all serve on United States public company boards.“The Overinflated Fear of Being Priced Out of Housing” (The Upshot, Economic View, June 12), Robert J.

Today the price is $400,000. If that’s “relatively tepid” growth, I’d hate to see it heat up!wrenhunter, BostonHousing price increases have been “tepid” in New York City?Ever been to Brooklyn?RebeccaTouger, New YorkLetters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
