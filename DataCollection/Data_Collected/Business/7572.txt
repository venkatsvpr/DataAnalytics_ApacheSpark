Nearly 80 years after kicking out foreign oil companies, Mexico reversed course on Wednesday, auctioning 14 exploration blocks in an effort to attract international energy giants and increase the country’s slumping production.But the results were a disappointment.Only two blocks were successfully auctioned, and the largest companies capable of investing big sums did not bid or refused to participate.The current low price of oil was a reason for the low number of bids. Prices are hovering around $50 a barrel, about half the price of a year ago.Another was that the lots offered in the first round of a multiyear auction process were not among the most commercially attractive, according to energy experts.Advertisement“It was disappointing, but this is a long-term process,” said Jorge Piñon, a former president of Amoco Oil Latin America. “I think Mexico is promising because folks are looking at what the price of oil will be three to five years from now, which is the period of time it will take to develop the deep water offshore fields.”The auction was a symbolically important step in a sweeping reform enacted last year. Under the plan by President Enrique Peña Nieto, foreign companies can now compete or partner with the national oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and profit from oil and gas production.The goal of the government is to increase the country’s oil production over the next decade by approximately 40 percent to 3.4 million barrels a day, or nearly 4 percent of current world production.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            The biggest growth will probably come in deep water fields that are adjacent to bountiful American production fields and that have yet to be thoroughly explored. The fields are thought to be large and have the added advantage of being close to the vast pipeline network in the American portion of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to American refineries and the American market itself.“People will look to the deep water,” said Gary Ross, executive chairman of Pira Energy Group, a global consultant company. “That’s where the great interest is and that’s where you are going to see a lot of international operations getting involved.”AdvertisementThe auction was the first of four rounds through 2019 that will include a total of 670 exploration areas and 244 fields already in production. The first deep water Gulf of Mexico fields are scheduled to go on the bidding block early next year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some companies have said they worry about provisions that allow the government to cancel contracts in cases of industrial accidents or spills.Before the bidding even began, Mexican officials lowered expectations. The round would be considered a success, they said, if just 30 to 50 percent of the blocks were auctioned off in the end.The biggest companies that qualified to bid in the first auction — Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total of France — decided not to make any offers. Royal Dutch Shell did not participate, but executives say they are still interested in investing in Mexico.“This turn toward growing Mexico’s energy future is historic and something we will continue to follow and evaluate with great interest,” said Mark Shuster, executive vice president for exploration at Shell Upstream Americas. He added that future major Mexican projects, particularly in the deep water Gulf of Mexico “will have to compete against our other global opportunities and choices.”Several other companies did make bids, including Nexen Energy Holdings of China, Statoil of Norway, Eni of Italy, ONGC Videsh of India and Hunt Overseas Oil Company.But some of the bids came below minimum terms set by Mexico. In others, companies submitted blank envelopes for bids.The only two blocks successfully auctioned went to the same low-profile consortium of Sierra Oil and Gas, a Mexican company; Talos Energy, which is based in Houston; and Premier Oil of Britain. In one block, the government will receive 56 percent of operating profits, and in the other block 69 percent. The two blocks contain oil, while others contained natural gas, whose price is extremely low.“We were starting to hear from many of the industry participants that some of the blocks were not ideal, not as attractive as people were expecting at the beginning,” said Oscar López-Velarde, Ernst & Young’s Mexico oil and gas tax leader and an adviser to several of the bidders.A version of this article appears in print on July 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexico Auctions Oil Blocks to Foreigners, but Sells Only Two .
