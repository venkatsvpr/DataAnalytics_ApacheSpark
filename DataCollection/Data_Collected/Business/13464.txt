Its shares fell more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in London on Thursday.On Thursday, the Royal Bank of Scotland said the complexity of the company’s customer and product mix made it “very challenging” to create a cloned information technology system for the new bank, and “the timetable to achieve separation is uncertain.”“R.B.S. is exploring alternative means to achieve separation and divestment,” the company said in a  news release. “The overall financial impact on R.B.S. is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated.”The company incurred £630 million in costs last year related to the separation of the Williams & Glyn business.The Royal Bank of Scotland hoped to spin off the business in the first quarter of 2017 but warned in February that a separation would not occur until after that date.Williams & Glyn had £25 billion in deposits at the end of the fourth quarter and about 1.6 million retail customers.The Royal Bank of Scotland is in the middle of a large restructuring as it shifts away from being a lender with global ambitions to focus on retail and corporate banking in Britain and Ireland. The lender announced plans last year to dismantle its global investment bank and to reduce the number of countries in which it operates.In March, it made a final payment of £1.19 billion to the British government, fulfilling a condition of its bailout package that gave the government priority for dividend payments.The government, which owns about 73 percent of the bank, hopes to reduce its holdings in the bank in the near future. The government raised about £2.1 billion in its first sale of shares it held in R.B.S. in August.Advertisement
