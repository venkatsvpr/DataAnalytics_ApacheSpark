Some parts of a claim may be granted and other parts denied. In those situations, neither party should pay the costs of the other unless the court is authorized to allocate costs based on its assessment of the merits of each party’s case.Peter Siviglia Tarrytown, N.Y., June 5The writer is the author of “Commercial Agreements: A Lawyer’s Guide to Drafting and Negotiating.”Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
