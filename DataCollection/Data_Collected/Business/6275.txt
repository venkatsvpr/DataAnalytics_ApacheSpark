LONDON — British regulators have raised concerns that the consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser’s planned acquisition of the K-Y brand of personal lubricants from Johnson & Johnson could lead to higher prices.Reckitt agreed in March to acquire the K-Y brand from Johnson & Johnson for an undisclosed amount. Reckitt also owns the Durex brand of condoms and lubricants.The Competition and Markets Authority of Britain said on Friday that K-Y and Durex account for nearly three-quarters of the market for personal lubricants sold in supermarkets and drugstore chains in Britain, where a vast majority of consumers buy those products.“There seems to be enough of an overlap in the market for personal lubricants for there to be a realistic prospect of consumers facing less competition and possibly higher prices if the two biggest brands come under single ownership,” Phil Evans, the chairman of the authority’s inquiry, said in a news release.AdvertisementThe regulator noted that consumers can choose competing products in specialty shops and online, but “there is little evidence that these other outlets will act as a brake on any price rises in national chains, and smaller suppliers have historically had little success getting access to the shelves in these larger shops.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The brand is available in more than 50 countries and had sales of more than $100 million in 2013.The Competition and Markets Authority is now seeking responses to its findings and will publish its final decision in August. Possible remedies include the sale or licensing of the K-Y brand in Britain to a company other than Reckitt.AdvertisementReckitt manufactures a variety of consumer products, including Air Wick air fresheners, Lysol cleaning sprays and French’s mustard.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
