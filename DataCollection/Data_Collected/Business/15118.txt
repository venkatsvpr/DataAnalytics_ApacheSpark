LONDON — A huge beer merger took two major steps toward completion on Friday.Anheuser-Busch InBev said it had received conditional approval from Chinese regulators for its merger with SABMiller after the companies agreed to sell SABMiller’s stake in the maker of Snow, the world’s best-selling beer. The conditional approval by Chinese authorities is the last major regulatory hurdle for the transaction.SABMiller’s board, meanwhile, said it would recommend that shareholders accept an increased cash offer by Anheuser-Busch InBev that valued it at about $104 billion.The merger would create an industry giant accounting for about 30 percent of global beer sales and would give Anheuser-Busch, already the world’s largest brewer, a substantial operation in Africa, where it has little presence, and greater dominance in Latin America.To win regulatory approval in China, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed in March to sell SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow to China Resources Beer, a state-owned brewer, for about $1.6 billion. China Resources Beer already owns the other 51 percent of the brewer, C. R. Snow.Advertisement“The Ministry of Commerce’s approval is a significant milestone for the transaction,” Anheuser-Busch InBev said in a news release on Friday. “It remains our objective to close the transaction in 2016.”AdvertisementAnheuser-Busch InBev has received regulatory approval in 23 jurisdictions for the transaction, including China, the European Union, South Africa and the United States.The brewer has entered into a number of agreements to sell assets from the combined company to satisfy regulators about the deal.In November, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell SABMiller’s 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to SABMiller’s partner in a joint venture, Molson Coors Brewing, for about $12 billion.In April, it accepted an offer by Asahi Group Holdings of Japan to buy the beer brands Grolsch, Meantime and Peroni, as well as associated SABMiller operations in Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.8 billion. And Anheuser-Busch InBev also said in April that it would be willing to sell SABMiller’s assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia as part of a package of divestments to win approval from European regulators.The approval in China came as Anheuser-Busch InBev hopes to convince SABMiller shareholders that the deal is worthwhile.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The share alternative was intended to allow them to avoid a huge tax bill from the sale of their holdings.AdvertisementBut some investors have raised concerns recently because the value of the share alternative has increased sharply as the value of the pound has fallen.On Tuesday, Aberdeen Asset Management, a SABMiller shareholder, said the revised deal remained “unacceptable” because it undervalued the company. Aberdeen said the deal favored SABMiller’s two largest shareholders and those shareholders should not be allowed to vote on the cash offer.On Friday, SABMiller’s board said it would recommend that shareholders accept the cash offer, but it said its two biggest shareholders should be treated as a separate class, allowing other investors to vote on the cash offer separately.Aberdeen said on Friday that although it still planned to vote against the deal, it welcomed the decision to treat the two largest shareholders as a separate class.“This acknowledges the reality of the situation and will help to ensure that the views of the rest of the investor base have due weight,” Aberdeen said.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Beer Merger Clears Two Hurdles, One in China and Another in the Board Room.
