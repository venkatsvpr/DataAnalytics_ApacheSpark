LONDON – Enthusiasm for initial public offerings returned with strength in Europe on Friday after having dimmed somewhat in the fourth quarter of last year.Four companies debuted their shares on exchanges across Europe, in one of the strongest starts to a year since the beginning of the financial crisis.They included an I.P.O. that valued the Swiss telecommunications company Sunrise Communications at $3.3 billion and an offering that valued GrandVision, the Dutch operator of the optical retailers Vision Express in Britain and Générale d’Optique in France, at $5.7 billion.And the British furniture retailer DFS said it planned to lists its shares in London and that it hopes to raise 105 million pounds, or about $160 million.Last year was one of the strongest for I.P.O.s in Europe since the financial crisis, with 239 offerings raising $66.2 billion in gross proceeds, according to data from Thomson Reuters.But enthusiasm for new offerings dipped in the final quarter of the year, as several I.P.O.s fizzled after their debuts, adding to concerns about the pace of Europe’s economic recovery.Since the new year, there have been 16 offerings, which have raised $3.84 billion in gross proceeds (not yet including the GrandVision I.P.O.), compared with seven offerings, raising $2.5 billion, at this point last year and 15 offerings, raising $1.18 billion, at this point in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters.The pickup comes as European stock indexes have climbed significantly higher from their lows in mid-December.Despite falls in European stocks on Friday, the FTSE 100, which tracks top British stocks, is up 11 percent from mid-December, while the DAX, which tracks German blue chip companies, is up more than 16 percent since mid-December. The CAC 40, which tracks the largest French stocks, is up 17 percent in the same period.Friday was one of the busiest days for new offerings so far this year, and investors showed renewed vigor. Several offerings were multiple times oversubscribed and shares moved higher in their debuts despite new worries about Greek debt casting a shadow over European markets.Sunrise, one of the largest telecommunications companies in Switzerland, priced the stock of its recently formed holding company at 68 Swiss francs a share, the middle of its expected pricing range, and raised 1.36 billion francs, or $1.47 billion, in the offering.Shares of Sunrise rose 6.9 percent to 72.70 francs in early trading in Zurich.The I.P.O. was oversubscribed and valued the holding company at 3.06 billion francs. The offering of 29.3 million shares represented about 65 percent of the new holding company’s capital.The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired Sunrise in October 2010 from the Danish telecommunications company TDC, paying 3.3 billion francs. CVC sold about nine million shares in the offering.Sunrise provides mobile, broadband and landline telephone services, and has 3.3 million customers, including about 27 percent of all mobile customers in Switzerland. It is a challenger to Swisscom, which dominates the country’s telecommunications market.GrandVision, the optical retail operator, said that it priced its stock at 20 euros a share, the upper end of its expected pricing range, and raised €1 billion, or about $1.1 billion, in the offering.Shares of GrandVision rose 2.4 percent to €20.48 in early trading in Amsterdam.The I.P.O. was oversubscribed and valued GrandVision at €5 billion.An indirect subsidiary of the Dutch investment group HAL Holding sold 51 million shares, or about a 20 percent stake in GrandVision, in the offering.GrandVision operates more than 5,600 stores in 43 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia, with about 80 percent of the stores directly owned by the company.In addition to Vision Express and Générale d’Optique, its brands include Apollo-Optik in Germany, Pearle Opticiens in the Netherlands and Ópticas Lux in Mexico.On Friday, Eltel, a Swedish provider of technical services to the power, communications and transportation industries, and Ferratum, a Finnish payday lender, also began trading their shares.Eltel priced its stock at 68 Swedish kronor a share, the upper end of its expected pricing range, and raised 1.3 billion kronor in the offering.Shares of Eltel rose 7.4 percent to 73 kronor in early trading in Stockholm on Friday.The I.P.O. was oversubscribed and valued Eltel at 4.26 billion kronor, or about $515 million.The offering of 36.7 million shares, including sales by BNP Paribas and the private equity firm 3i Group, represented about 58.5 percent of Eltel.Ferratum priced its shares at €17 a share, raising €110.8 million in an offering of 6.5 million shares.Its stock rose 7 percent to €18.20 in early trading in Frankfurt on Friday.
