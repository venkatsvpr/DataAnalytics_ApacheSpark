LONDON —  Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Wednesday that it had completed an agreement to acquire its closest rival, SABMiller, for nearly $106 billion, creating what it said would be the first “truly global brewer.”The deal, reached after months of negotiations, would create a beer industry giant with annual revenue of about $64 billion and would give Anheuser-Busch InBev, already the world’s largest brewer, a substantial operation in Africa, where it has little presence, and greater dominance in Latin America.The question now is how much regulators will challenge the deal, which would create a company responsible for nearly 30 percent of all beer sales worldwide. The combined company’s brands would include Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser, Corona Extra and Stella Artois and SABMiller’s Grolsch and Peroni.In the effort to appease regulators, SABMiller said on Wednesday that it would sell its 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to its joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch InBev.AdvertisementAnalysts have raised concerns that the companies might be forced to make a similar concession to regulators in China, where SABMiller holds a 49 percent stake in a joint venture that owns Snow, China’s best-selling beer brand.AdvertisementAnheuser-Busch InBev is the third largest brewer in the Chinese beer market behind CR Snow, SABMiller’s joint venture, and Tsingtao Brewery, but would become the country’s largest brewer by market share if it is allowed to keep the stake.China Resources Enterprise, SABMiller’s joint venture partner, would be a likely buyer if they were forced to sell, analysts said.On Wednesday, Carlos Brito, the Anheuser-Busch chief executive, said the brewer would be “prompt, proactive and decisive” in addressing concerns by regulators.“In markets, such as China, South Africa and other jurisdictions, we also intend to work closely with SABMiller to address any regulatory requirements,” he said in a conference call with journalists.Mr. Brito did not address how Anheuser-Busch InBev planned to tackle the overlap in China or the combined company’s soft drink bottling operations for its rivals Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.SABMiller is an important bottler for Coca-Cola in Africa, while Anheuser-Busch InBev is an important bottler for PepsiCo in Latin America.Anheuser-Busch InBev has argued that it thinks the combined company’s geographic footprint is “largely complementary.”AdvertisementAs part of the transaction, Anheuser-Busch InBev would pay a $3 billion fee to SABMiller if regulators did not approve the merger, the companies said.Anheuser-Busch InBev has tackled similar issues before.It was forced to restructure its $20.1 billion takeover of Grupo Modelo of Mexico in 2013 after the Justice Department sued to block that deal.Among the concessions on that deal, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell the rights to Corona beer and other Grupo Modelo brands in the United States to Constellation Brands, one of the world’s largest wine companies, for $2.9 billion.
                The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.            Selling SABMiller’s stake in MillerCoors could eliminate a major regulatory hurdle: Many analysts had predicted that the United States Justice Department would seek the sale or breakup of the joint venture.MillerCoors was formed by SABMiller and Molson Coors in 2008 to combine their United States operations. That partnership owns several major brands in the United States, including Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon.As part of the deal to sell its stake, SABMiller would give up its rights to the Miller brand worldwide and MillerCoors would retain the rights to sell brands it currently holds in its portfolio in the United States, including Peroni and Pilsner Urquell. That sale depends on the closing of the Anheuser-Busch transaction.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of next year.“With little geographic overlap between the two companies, it is of little surprise the deal has been agreed, and the deal will also have limited antitrust issues,” said Jeremy Cunnington, an analyst with the research firm Euromonitor International.Euromonitor estimated that a combined Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller could account for 29 percent of global beer sales, after selling some assets to win regulatory approval. It would also be more than three times as large in terms of sales as its next closest competitor, the Dutch brewer Heineken, according to Euromonitor.The Anheuser-Busch InBev deal for SABMiller came together after the companies reached an agreement in principle on Oct. 13. Since then, they had been negotiating the details of the merger.The announcement that they had completed the deal came just before a deadline on Wednesday, under British takeover rules, for Anheuser-Busch InBev to make what is considered a formal offer. If Anheuser-Busch InBev had missed the deadline, it would not have been allowed to make another approach for up to six months.SABMiller’s board is recommending that shareholders accept the deal.Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay £44 in cash a share for SABMiller. That would be a premium of more than 50 percent on SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September, before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was announced.SABMiller’s two largest shareholders — the American tobacco giant Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia — have agreed to support the deal and to accept a partial share alternative in which they would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at £41.85 a share, a discount to the cash price. That would allow them to avoid a huge tax bill from the sale of their holdings.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay £69.8 billion.Anheuser-Busch InBev said that it expected to achieve about $1.4 billion in annual cost savings by the end of the fourth year after the deal’s completion.AdvertisementThe combined company expects to have a primary listing of its shares in Belgium, where Anheuser-Busch InBev is based, and secondary listings in Mexico, South Africa and the United States.Lazard, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Standard Bank and the law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and Clifford Chance advised Anheuser-Busch InBev.SABMiller was advised by Robey Warshaw, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and the law firms Linklaters, Hogan Lovells and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.
