Mr. Macri took office six months ago after a period of market isolation under the previous administration. Argentina had been cut off from global markets after a $100 billion debt default in 2001 and a long legal battle with hedge fund creditors that was resolved this year.Argentina’s government returned to global bond markets in April, after a 15-year hiatus, with an issuance of $16.5 billion. Several of the nation’s provinces have been raising money on these bond markets in recent weeks.Havanna, which makes alfajores, a sweet biscuit snack, and runs more than 300 coffee shops in Argentina and across Latin America, sold 4.27 million shares — 10 percent of the company — at 37 pesos per share, valuing it at around $114.7 million.Demand doubled the number of shares offered, so they were priced at the top of the marketed range.“There was so much demand for this stock,” said Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, a brokerage firm in Buenos Aires that managed Havanna’s sale. “This is very encouraging not only for Havanna, but for other companies who want to go public.”Despite the small size of the offering, 17 percent of orders came from abroad, Mr. Ilac said.While initial price offerings from Argentina have been sporadic in recent years, Havanna is predicted to lead a fresh wave in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.Already, Grupo Supervielle — the holding company for Banco Supervielle, a bank — raised $280 million last month in an initial public offering in both New York and Buenos Aires. But Havanna’s offering was the first entirely local equity offering since the oil company Petrolera Pampa’s in 2013.Mr. Macri’s government is dealing with an overhaul of the economy, including efforts to bolster growth, rein in inflation and narrow the fiscal deficit. But if policy makers face serious setbacks, analysts say, this would suppress investor demand in Argentina.“Sustaining this incipient interest in Argentine assets from financial markets depends on how the macro-economy evolves,” said Gastón Rossi, an economist at a consulting firm in Buenos Aires.Advertisement
