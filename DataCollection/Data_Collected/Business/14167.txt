Both hedge funds eventually shut their doors.The investigation led to the filing of insider trading charges against Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback, and Anthony Chiasson, a founder of Level Global. Both men were convicted on insider trading charges, but the appellate court threw out the convictions in a ruling that dramatically narrowed the ability of authorities to pursue certain kinds of insider trading cases.Diamondback, according to the court filing, agreed to “hold harmless” prosecutors and the F.B.I. as part of the decision to return the money. The $6 million represented what authorities said were profits “based, in whole, or in part, on material nonpublic information obtained and utilized by Diamondback employees in an illegal manner.”Steve bruce, a spokesman for Diamondback Capital said, “We recognize that it is highly unusual for the government to voluntarily take this action, and appreciate their efforts to bring fair and final closure to the matter.”Mr. Bharara has criticized the appellate ruling in the Newman case and was disappointed when the Supreme Court refused to take the matter up on appeal. And while Mr. Bharara has said he disagrees with the ruling, his office subsequently dismissed convictions and guilty pleas it had obtained against several other people in light of the decision.The return of money to Diamondback now moves Mr. Bharara’s office one step closer to closing the door on the fallout from the Newman case.Advertisement
