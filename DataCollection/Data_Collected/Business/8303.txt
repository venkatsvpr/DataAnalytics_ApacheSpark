Reckitt also owns the Durex brand of condoms and lubricants.In May, the Competition and Markets Authority of Britain said it was concerned that the acquisition of the K-Y brand could lead to higher prices. K-Y and Durex account for nearly three-quarters of the market for personal lubricants sold in supermarkets and drugstore chains in Britain, where a vast majority of consumers buy the products, the regulator said.By licensing the K-Y brand, a competitor to Reckitt Benckiser would then have an existing platform from which to develop a new brand to compete with Durex in Britain, Phil Evans, the chairman of the authority’s inquiry, said in a news release.The eight-year license would make it easier for the new brand to gain access to supermarkets and national pharmacy chains — and a larger customer basis — in order to protect competition, he said.In a summary of its final report, the Competition and Markets Authority said there was little evidence that specialty shops and online outlets, which offer competing products, “could act as a brake on any price rises in supermarkets and national pharmacy chains.”“Historically smaller-scale suppliers have had little success getting access to the shelves in these larger shops,” the regulator said.The K-Y brand began as a prescription medical product in 1917 and has been sold over the counter since 1980. The brand is available in more than 50 countries and had sales of over $100 million in 2013.In addition to the Durex brand, Reckitt manufactures a variety of consumer products, including Air Wick air fresheners, Lysol cleaning sprays and French’s mustard.Advertisement
