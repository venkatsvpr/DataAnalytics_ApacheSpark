LONDON — The Serious Fraud Office of Britain said on Monday that it had closed its investigation into suspected accounting and disclosure abuses connected to Hewlett-Packard’s $11 billion purchase of the British technology company Autonomy.The investigation, started in early 2013, followed accusations from HP in 2012 that Autonomy had carried out a series of accounting abuses that forced the United States tech giant to write down $8.8 billion from its takeover of the British company.HP has said that more than $5 billion of that charge was related to accounting and disclosure abuses at Autonomy, which, according to the tech giant, misrepresented the company’s sales and growth targets for its software business.Mike Lynch, the former chief executive of Autonomy, has denied the accusations, saying that the company’s accounting practices were legitimate. He has repeatedly called on HP to withdraw its allegations.After reviewing the Autonomy sale, the British authorities said on Monday that they would end their investigation, though a similar inquiry by the American authorities into potential accounting abuses would continue.“In respect of some aspects of the allegations, the S.F.O. has concluded that, on the information available to it, there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction,” the British authorities said in a statement on Monday.
