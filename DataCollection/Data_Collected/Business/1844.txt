That proposal, amounting to $21.70 a share in cash, tops a $20-a-share offer from ON Semiconductor that Fairchild accepted last month.Also participating in the Chinese takeover effort is Hua Capital Management, an investment firm that led the takeover of the imaging chip maker OmniVision Technologies last spring.Fairchild acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday that it had received an unsolicited takeover bid that was higher than ON Semiconductor’s offer, though it did not disclose the identity of the suitor. Bloomberg News later reported that the Chinese entities were behind the bid.The move by the China Resources and Hua highlights the continued interest by Chinese buyers in the chip-manufacturing industry. This year, Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s biggest semiconductor maker, weighed a takeover of Micron Technology, a maker of memory chips.Adding Fairchild, whose chips help regulate power use in computers and other devices, could bolster the semiconductor arm of China Resources, an enormous conglomerate whose other arms include supermarkets and power plants.The China Resources consortium emerged as a suitor late in an auction of Fairchild earlier this year and was willing to pay at least $20.20 a share, according to the person briefed on the matter. But by that point, Fairchild essentially had committed to striking a deal with ON Semiconductor.Fairchild’s agreement with ON Semiconductor does not include a so-called go-shop period that allows the company to solicit higher takeover offers. But the chip maker can evaluate unsolicited bids that it receives.In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that it would review the new proposal, though its board was still recommending that shareholders accept ON Semiconductor’s deal.One potential hurdle for the Chinese consortium is the prospect of a tough review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an American government panel that reviews takeovers by foreign buyers. That regulator has sometimes looked unfavorably on Chinese companies bidding for American tech companies, though the China Resources group is likely to argue that Fairchild’s chips are not vital to the national security of the United States.Advertisement
