Staley, Barclays is focusing its strategy around two divisions: the British consumer bank, and the corporate and investment bank.“I am delighted by the speed with which we are continuing to reduce our noncore exposure and costs,” Mr. Staley said in a news release on Thursday. “Our credit card operation in Spain and Portugal is a very good business with a highly talented and dedicated work force but no longer fits with our strategic ambitions.”Barclays said the business consists of about 1 billion pounds, or about $1.46 billion, in assets.The sale to Bancopopular-e, which is owned by the investment firm Varde Partners and Banco Popular Español, is subject to regulatory approval and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year.Advertisement
