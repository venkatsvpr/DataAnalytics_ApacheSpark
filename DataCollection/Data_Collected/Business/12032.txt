LONDON — HSBC said on Monday that it lost money in the fourth quarter and warned that it was being investigated for hiring candidates with ties to government officials in the Asia-Pacific region.The lender, which is based in Britain but generates more than half its earnings in Asia, also forecast that slowing economic growth in China would contribute to a “bumpier financial environment.”For the three months that ended Dec. 31, HSBC, Britain’s largest by assets, posted a loss of $1.33 billion, compared with a profit of $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Before taxes, HSBC posted a loss of $858 million in the final quarter of last year.In addition to reporting its earnings, HSBC said that it and “multiple financial institutions” were facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator, HSBC said, was looking into the hiring of candidates who were referred by, or related to, government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia.Advertisement“HSBC has received various requests for information and is cooperating with the S.E.C.’s investigation,” the lender said.AdvertisementIn 2013, the commission opened an investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase had hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help the bank get lucrative deals. That inquiry has since expanded to include the hiring practices of other banks in Asia.For all of last year, HSBC reported a pretax profit of $18.9 billion, compared with $18.7 billion in 2014.But the lender’s quarterly results were weighed down by restructuring costs and provisions for legal and regulatory matters, including a $370 million charge for potential settlements and $337 million to compensate customers who were improperly sold products in Britain. The quarter also included loan-impairment charges and provisions for credit risk of $1.64 billion and a reduction in the fair market value of its debt.In Asia, the bank’s pretax profit of $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter was lower than some analysts had expected.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            In a research note, the Citigroup analysts Ronit Ghose and Andrew Coombs said they had expected a pretax profit of $3.5 billion from HSBC’s Asian business in the fourth quarter, but the bank had lower revenue than Citigroup had forecast and “slightly higher” provisions on loan losses.Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said in a news release that “China’s slower economic growth will undoubtedly contribute to a bumpier financial environment, but it is still expected to be the largest contributor to global growth as its economy transitions to higher added value manufacturing and services and becomes more consumer driven.”Shares of HSBC declined as much as 5 percent in early trading in London on Monday and were still down 3.75 percent in midafternoon trading. They fell about 2 percent in Hong Kong.AdvertisementThe loss in the fourth quarter came as HSBC was reshaping its operations, including plans announced in June to shed tens of thousands of jobs, to sell several underperforming businesses and to shrink its global investment banking business.The bank said on Monday that it had decided to retain and restructure its business in Turkey, which would have accounted for some of the job cuts. HSBC said that it had received several offers since putting the business up for sale in June, but that none “were deemed to be in the best interests of shareholders.”Last week, HSBC, which was founded in 1865 as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Hong Kong, said it would keep its headquarters in Britain after a lengthy review. In announcing its decision, HSBC said that Asia remained “at the heart of the group’s strategy.”The lender announced the formal review in April, citing increasing regulatory requirements and a tax that had hit banks based in Britain particularly hard. The political environment, however, shifted after the Conservative Party gained full power in May 2014, after five years of a coalition government. Since then, the British government has softened its tone on the banking industry, hoping to keep London an attractive home for such businesses.On a conference call with reporters, the bank’s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said it was unlikely that HSBC would again review whether to move its headquarters from London if Britain were to decide in a June referendum to leave the European Union.HSBC employs about 46,000 people in Britain, but a British exit would not affect the bulk of those jobs, Mr. Gulliver said.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That is down from £7.62 million in 2014.Revenue at HSBC fell 22 percent to $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter, from $13 billion in the period a year earlier.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined 5 percent to $8.06 billion in the period, from $8.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.Pretax profit in HSBC’s investment bank, known as global banking and markets, rose to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter, from a loss of $85 million in the period a year earlier. Pretax profit at its commercial banking business and its retail and wealth management unit both fell, however.The bank also said that an independent monitor, appointed as part of a deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2012 with the United States government, had expressed “significant concerns” about HSBC’s efforts to put in place a financial-crime compliance program. Those remarks came after the Justice Department said last year, in a summary of the monitor’s findings, that the pace of the lender’s progress was “too slow.”In 2012, HSBC agreed to a $1.9 billion settlement after it was accused of laundering money for drug cartels and transferring funds for Iran and other nations under United States sanctions.Mr. Flint said that the bank was confident its program was “designed well,” but he added that the monitor had “specific, very detailed technical issues” that needed to be addressed.“It’s kind of a work in progress,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: HSBC Posts 4th-Quarter Loss and Discloses S.E.C.
