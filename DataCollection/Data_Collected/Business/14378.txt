MADRID — Inditex, the world’s biggest clothing retailer, beat forecasts on Wednesday with a 6 percent rise in profits, driven by strong sales as fast turnover allowed the owner of the fashion chain Zara to react quickly to unseasonable weather.The first-quarter results sent shares in Inditex, one of the most expensive retail stocks globally, up 3.2 percent, outperforming its Swedish rival, H&M, which reported a pickup in sales growth in May after a fall in its first-quarter profit.Inditex, known for whisking the latest trends from runway to stores in a matter of days, is bucking a broader industry trend as other major fashion retailers complain of weak demand.The group said its full stable of brands — from the housewares store Zara Home to the upmarket clothing label Massimo Dutti — would have an online presence in all European countries and Turkey by the end of this financial year.AdvertisementInditex reported a net profit of 554 million euros, or $623 million, for the three months to April 30, beating a Reuters forecast of €541 million, as sales jumped 12 percent above the same period a year earlier. However, results were tempered by negative currency effects.Sales of lingerie-inspired dresses, oversize shirts and other items from Zara also helped push sales across the group’s brands up 15 percent, at constant exchange rates, in the first weeks of the second quarter, from May 1 to June 13, the company said.Advertisement“In a market environment where most retailers are bemoaning the weather, Inditex’s results demonstrate the strength of the business model and its ability to deliver superior results,” said Jamie Merriman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
