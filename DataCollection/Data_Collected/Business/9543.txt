LONDON — Libya, in the words of one lawyer, “was like the Wild West” in 2008, when Goldman Sachs bankers arrived in the capital, Tripoli.With the lifting of sanctions against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s regime, the country was beginning to open to foreign companies after years of isolation. For banks like Goldman, the desert nation had a promising potential client: a newly created sovereign wealth fund backed by billions of dollars of oil wealth.What happened next was fought out in a London courtroom this summer.In a trial that revealed tales of prostitutes and lavish spending on hotels and meals, the Libyans accused Goldman of exerting undue influence over its employees and pushing the fund into improper investments that led to more than $1 billion in losses. Goldman argued that the Libyan fund was far more sophisticated than it had claimed and was simply suffering from “buyer’s remorse.”On Friday, a London judge came down heavily in Goldman’s favor, sparing the Wall Street firm from paying a huge sum in damages. The ruling also provides some relief after several embarrassing overseas predicaments that have dogged Goldman and its reputation this year.AdvertisementThe judge, Justice Vivien Rose of the High Court here, found that the relationship between Goldman Sachs and the fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, “did not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and a client.”AdvertisementThe judge also found that the fees that Goldman earned on the disputed trades were not excessive “given the nature of the trades and the work that had gone into winning them.”Although the disputed trades may be regarded as unsuitable for a sovereign wealth fund, “there were other reasons why the L.I.A. wanted to enter into them and, if they were unsuitable, they were no different from many other investments that the L.I.A. made over the period in that regard,” the judge said in her 120-page ruling.After the ruling, the Libyan Investment Authority said it was “disappointed” with the court’s decision.“Time will be needed fully to digest the judgment, and all options are being considered at this time,” the fund said in a statement.In a statement, Goldman said, “We are pleased to win this case, with a comprehensive judgment in our favor.”The Libyan Investment Authority argued at trial that it was improperly steered into a series of complicated derivatives transactions by Goldman — when it simply wanted to invest in the stocks of Western companies — and lost $1.2 billion after the financial crisis hit, while Goldman pocketed more than $200 million in fees.The nine derivatives transactions were tied to the stocks of Citigroup, the French utility EDF and other companies.AdvertisementThe court heard testimony from fund officials claiming that there was considerable anger when they discovered how risky the derivatives were. A lawyer for the Libyan Investment Authority told of a fund official’s storming into a board room to scream obscenities at two Goldman bankers and telling them to leave Libya.“I remember thinking that I had experienced the strangest meeting of my career between one of the largest sovereign wealth funds and one of the biggest international banks,” she said.Despite such colorful descriptions, the trial featured few documents — and no testimony — from the major decision makers at the center of the dispute.
                A London court judged that the Wall Street firm hadn’t taken advantage of the inexperienced sovereign wealth fund.            Muhammad Layas, the chairman and chief executive of the Libyan Investment Authority, died in 2015, and Mustafa Zarti, the fund’s former deputy chairman, did not testify in the case.Many of the fund’s documents from before October 2013 were either destroyed or lost. One of Colonel Qaddafi’s sons used the building in Tripoli where the sovereign wealth fund has its offices as his base during the revolution that unseated the Libyan leader and led to his death.Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker and an important contact for the wealth fund, also did not testify.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Questions have been raised — and the bank has been sued — about its relationship with the prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak.United States authorities have accused Mr. Najib and people close to him of embezzling billions of dollars from Malaysia’s state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.In Britain, Goldman was dragged into the controversy surrounding the collapse of one of country’s best-known retailers, BHS, over its role as an informal adviser to Philip Green, the chain’s former owner.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.A version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Goldman Wins Suit vs. Fund in Libya.
