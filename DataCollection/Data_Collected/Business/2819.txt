More than 100 former Wells Fargo loan officers accepted kickbacks – including one former employee’s wife who collected tens of thousands of dollars in payments  – as part of a scheme to steer business to a now defunct title insurance company, a federal regulator said on Thursday.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the former Wells employees would steer business to Genuine Title, a title insurance company in Maryland, in return for leads on new mortgage borrowers and other marketing help.In one case, Genuine Title paid tens of thousands of dollars to a former Wells Fargo employee’s wife as kickbacks for business referrals.A half-dozen former JPMorgan Chase loan officers also accepted kickbacks in the form of marketing help in return for referring business to Genuine Title, which went out of business last April.As part of a consent order with the C.F.P.B., Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $24 million penalty and $10.8 million to consumers harmed by the scheme. JPMorgan was fined $600,000 and must pay $300,000 to customers.“These banks allowed their loan officers to focus on their own illegal financial gain rather than on treating customers fairly,’’ Richard Cordray, the director of the C.F.P.B., said in a statement. “Our action today to address these practices should serve as a warning to all those in the mortgage market.”In a civil complaint filed Thursday, the C.F.P.B. said the banks violated the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which prohibits parties involved in a real estate deal from giving or accepting fees or kickbacks in exchange for business referrals.The more than 100 Wells employees involved in the scheme, which took place from 2009 to 2013, have either left the bank or were fired after the agency concluded its investigation, a Wells Fargo spokesman said. Most of the Wells employees worked in Maryland and Virginia.Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said in a statement that the bank had taken “strong corrective action, including terminating team members who were involved and enhancing our procedures to provide greater oversight and monitoring of both the process and our team members.”Two of the six former JPMorgan employees the C.F.P.B. said were involved in the scheme were fired. The other four had already left the bank.“We are fully committed to ensuring that our mortgage bankers comply with all legal and regulatory requirements,’’ Jason Lobo, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in a statement. “These former employees clearly violated our policies, procedures and training.”
