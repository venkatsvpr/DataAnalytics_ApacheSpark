Carl C. Icahn has sold his 45.8 million Apple shares since the start of the year, telling CNBC on Thursday that he was concerned about China’s policies regarding the technology giant while still calling the stock cheap.Mr. Icahn, the activist investor known for making splashy headlines and rattling corporate boards, said during a telephone interview broadcast around midday that he was concerned the Chinese government could make it difficult for Apple to do business in that country.“It is about China,” he said. “China could be a shadow for it, and we have to look at that.” He added that he thought Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, was doing “a great job.”Shares of Apple were down 3 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday.Two days earlier, Mr. Cook said sales of Apple products in China fell 11 percent in its second fiscal quarter ending in March compared with the same period a year ago.Mr. Icahn had already been paring his Apple holdings, selling seven million shares in the fourth quarter, according to his February regulatory filing. Another hedge fund, Tiger Global Management, acquired a new 10.6-million-share stake in the fourth quarter, according to the research service Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Mr. Icahn’s stake of 45.8 million shares as of the end of the year was valued at $4.77 billion as of Wednesday’s closing share price, according to Capital IQ. That was down from $4.82 billion reported in the filing. He said that he had made $2 billion on Apple shares after first investing in them about three years ago.A version of this article appears in print on April 29, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Icahn Says He Has Sold His Large Stake in Apple.
