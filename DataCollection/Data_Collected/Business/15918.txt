LubbenThe Hanjin Shipping Company filed for bankruptcy in South Korea on Aug. 31, and sought recognition of that bankruptcy in the United States under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code, which governs such matters.In the meantime, there has been apparent chaos as ships have been milling about off shore, stranding cargo and crew and even a filmmaker in a kind of insolvency limbo.Perhaps what is most surprising about this entire event is the apparent lack of planning that went into this bankruptcy case. It certainly does not reflect well on the company’s board, which should have gotten bankruptcy professionals involved early to prepare the bankruptcy filing and account for the company’s assets throughout the world.Indeed, the apparent lack of insolvency planning is one aspect of this case that does clearly resemble Lehman Brothers and its haphazard collapse into bankruptcy.For example, whenever an airline files for bankruptcy, which has happened with notable frequency, it is common to make sure that the filing does not happen with planes on the ground in “unfavorable” jurisdictions.Likewise, plans have to be made to have cash positioned where it will be needed in the early days of the case, when the filing is apt to cause the greatest disruption. Such liquidity only now seems to be coming online in the Hanjin case, long after the damage has been done, and in relatively paltry amounts.This could have been a moment for the Korean insolvency system to shine. But that would have required advanced planning on both the insolvency and financing side. American Airlines – which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few years back with little noticeable effect on its operations – provides an important counterexample here.Unfortunately, it seems more likely that Hanjin will simply increase the trend for international insolvency cases to cluster in financial centers like New York and London, which has important implications for legitimacy of transnational insolvency.Advertisement
