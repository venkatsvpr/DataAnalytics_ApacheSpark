AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedBayer of Germany has made a takeover bid for Monsanto, potentially signaling another huge merger in the business of crop seeds and pesticides.While the companies did not disclose details of the offer, a tie-up of the two companies would yield a giant whose products encompass antibiotics, genetically modified crop seeds and pesticides. It would have a combined annual revenue of more than $67 billion.In a short statement late Wednesday, Monsanto said its board was reviewing the proposal. Bayer said early Thursday that it had recently met with Monsanto executives to discuss a potential deal, saying it “would create a leading integrated agriculture business.”News of Bayer’s interest in Monsanto has percolated over the last several weeks, stirring speculation that the agricultural sector could see another big deal after Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed last year to merge.As crop prices fall, analysts and investors have anticipated a flurry of deals among companies that service the farming industry. Monsanto, which failed to buy its rival Syngenta last year, has been seen as a potentially attractive takeover target.The company is the world’s biggest seller of seeds, including those for genetically modified crops that can better withstand pesticides.Monsanto’s unsuccessful bid for Syngenta, a pesticide maker, would have been worth $47 billion. But Syngenta steadfastly rejected entreaties, arguing that the offer was too low and that a potential deal would run afoul of antitrust regulators.Syngenta, which is based in Switzerland, eventually agreed, early this year, to sell itself to the China National Chemical Corporation.Afterward, Monsanto said that it was no longer interested in striking huge mergers, instead pursuing what would largely be a self-help strategy.Shares in the company have slipped 1.4 percent so far this year, closing on Wednesday at $97.13.Bayer and BASF had each expressed interest in exploring some kind of joint venture with Monsanto in recent months.It was unclear whether Monsanto is interested in pursuing a sale to either Bayer or BASF. A top executive at the seed company told Reuters at an investor conference on Wednesday that talk of a deal with either company was “wild speculation.”Advising Monsanto on its review of the Bayer proposal are Morgan Stanley, the boutique investment bank Ducera Partners and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Advertisement
