Fiat Chrysler Autombiles is recalling about 500,000 2007-10 Jeep Wranglers, including 392,000 in the United States, because the driver’s-side airbag may not deploy in a crash, the automaker said on Wednesday.In addition, about 7,400 2011-16 Wranglers with right-hand drive, typically used for mail delivery, are being recalled in the United States.The action stems from investigations last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and its Canadian counterpart, Transport Canada.The automaker said the problem was that the clock spring, part of the system that activates the airbag, could be contaminated with dust and dirt during “extensive off-road driving or driving with a vehicle’s top and/or doors removed.” The Wrangler is designed for off-road driving.AdvertisementIf the clock spring is contaminated, an airbag warning light will illuminate.The automaker said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem. The investigation last year by federal regulators quoted the automaker saying there had been four injuries. But the automaker investigated further and “discovered those reports were unrelated” to the clock spring failures, a spokesman, Eric Mayne, said on Wednesday in an email.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If there are no recalls for this problem the dealer will not fix it,” wrote an Apple Valley, Calif., owner of a 2007 Wrangler.AdvertisementOne owner said the dealer wanted $800 for the repair.In addition to the vehicles in the United States, the action covers about 35,000 in Canada, 8,500 in Mexico and almost 63,000 outside North America.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
