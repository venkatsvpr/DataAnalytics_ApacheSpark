Video from the eighth crash test of a Trinity guardrail, which shows a Geo Metro spinning out after hitting the guardrail, causing the driver’s door to strike a bent piece of metal.Thousands of guardrails on American roads, made under an old safety standard, may experience problems if hit by vehicles at certain angles or if they were improperly installed, according to federal and state transportation officials.The Federal Highway Administration and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a nonprofit group that represents state transportation officials, released a joint report on Friday that documented dozens of crashes involving guardrails as well as the potentially dangerous performance limitations of roadside equipment.In a shift, the officials recommended laying out a timetable in which stricter testing standards would be applied to newer guardrails. Although more rigorous guidelines were put in place in 2011, states are still allowed to buy and install roadside devices that were tested under older standards — a point that has been criticized by lawmakers and safety advocates.The report’s conclusions follow a year of intense scrutiny for the guardrail maker Trinity Industries, which has been accused of making a guardrail terminal, the ET-Plus, that can jam and spear through vehicles. The Justice Department, with the cooperation of the Transportation Department inspector general’s office, is conducting a criminal investigation into the company and its dealings with the Federal Highway Administration.AdvertisementIn June, a Texas judge handed down a $663 million judgment against Trinity after a trial held last October in a whistle-blower case filed by Joshua Harman, a competitor who discovered in 2011 that Trinity had made a key change to its ET-Plus guardrail in 2005, but failed to tell federal regulators as required by law. In that case, the jury found the company liable for defrauding the government. Trinity has filed a notice of appeal.AdvertisementAfter the fraud verdict, the federal highway agency asked for documentation of real-world crashes involving the guardrail. The joint report issued Friday is based on that call for information, but extended beyond just the ET-Plus and encompassed guardrails made by another manufacturer, Road Systems.
            A sequence from video footage of a crash test in San Antonio in January, in which a compact car collided with a Trinity ET-Plus guardrail head. The car spins out and the metal guardrail bends to form a sharp “elbow,” which the vehicle then strikes on the driver’s side.        John C. Durkos, a vice president at Road Systems, said he applauded the move to the newer safety standards but cautioned that it was “not going to fix bad installation, bad maintenance or extreme conditions.” He also said that one of the guardrail systems that was part of the analysis, the Sequential Kinking Terminal, had since been tested under the newer standards and that the company was gathering information to formally submit those results to the federal government.The report did not offer a relative comparison of one type of guardrail with another, but found that vulnerabilities were not limited to any one brand. It also did not call for removing existing guardrails that were tested under the older standards.“We are happy that they are moving to implement a more stringent standard but are disappointed they are not taking products off the road that they acknowledge are less safe,” said Nicholas A. Gravante Jr. of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, a lawyer representing Mr. Harman.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In March, the agency announced that the guardrails had passed the tests, including a final crash test in which the device bent and smashed in the driver-side door of the test car.On Friday, Jeffrey F. Paniati, the Federal Highway Administration’s executive director, reiterated that the agency was still confident in those tests. But the agency said it was planning to monitor crash tests of the ET-Plus that have recently been ordered by Virginia officials. They will begin next week and will include low-angle testing.A version of this article appears in print on September 12, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Report Finds New Risks in Approved Guardrails.
