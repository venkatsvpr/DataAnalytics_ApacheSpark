The biggest beer merger in history has taken a major step toward completion.Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Wednesday that the United States Justice Department had cleared its $106 billion proposed takeover of SABMiller, provided some conditions were met, all but clearing the way for the two biggest brewers in the world to merge.That would combine the maker of the Budweiser and Miller beers into one company, with an estimated global market share of about 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.Under the terms of Anheuser’s agreement with the Justice Department, the combined company would not buy a distributor if that would push more than 10 percent of its overall sales volume in the country through wholly owned distributors.Anheuser also agreed not to cut any ties with wholesalers as part of the transaction. And the company, which makes Bud Light, agreed not to make moves that would encourage distributors to favor Anheuser or SABMiller brands over competing ones.AdvertisementThe conditions dovetail with some existing pledges made by the beer giant, including selling the combined company’s majority stake in the MillerCoors joint venture to Molson Coors. That $12 billion sale would mean that Anheuser’s overall market share in the United States — 45 percent — would not change if the SABMiller merger went through.AdvertisementAnheuser also agreed to sell brands like Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan for about $2.9 billion.And Anheuser agreed this year to sell SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in Snow, the most popular beer in China, to a state-owned brewer, China Resources Beer Holdings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Even after divesting itself of the stakes in MillerCoors and Snow, SABMiller still provides a significant presence in the African beer market, which continues to grow.The SABMiller deal so far has won regulatory approval in 21 jurisdictions, including Europe, South Korea and South Africa.One country that has not yet blessed the proposed transaction is China, though its regulators are expected to approve the deal.The proposed union is also subject to shareholder approval.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
