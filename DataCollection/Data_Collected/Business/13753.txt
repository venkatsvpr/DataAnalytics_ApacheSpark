The investigation began with a series of raids by the British authorities in March 2010.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain accused Mr. Dodgson of improperly sharing information from the investment banks where he worked with his close friend, Mr. Hind, as part of a conspiracy that began in November 2006 and ended in March 2010.Mr. Hind acted as a middle man and helped facilitate trades for the benefit of Mr. Dodgson and himself, the Financial Conduct Authority said.The tips included inside information about the Paragon Group, Legal & General and BSkyB, the regulator said.Three other men on trial with Mr. Hind and Mr. Dodgson were acquitted of criminal charges this week.The members of the conspiracy used unregistered mobile telephones, encrypted records and safe deposit boxes to hide their improper trading from authorities, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Five people in all have pleaded guilty or been convicted of criminal charges in the investigation.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @ChadbrayAdvertisement
