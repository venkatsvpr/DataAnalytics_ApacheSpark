The inquiry began in 2011.In December 2013, the European Union fined a group of global financial institutions a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they had colluded to fix benchmark interest rates, including the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. It was the largest combined penalty ever levied by European competition authorities.The three banks fined on Wednesday did not settle in 2013. The potential fines against those that did settle were reduced 10 percent.Asked how much money the collusion had made for the banks involved, Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner in charge of European competition policy, told a news conference in Brussels that she could not give a precise figure.Euribor and other benchmark interest rates help determine the costs of borrowing for trillions of dollars in loans, credit cards and mortgages.To set the Euribor and other benchmarks, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and maturities.In its investigation, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, found that traders at seven banks, including Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, were involved in a cartel between September 2005 and May 2008 to improperly influence the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives.The commission found that the traders, using chat rooms and instant messaging services, had shared their desired or intended submissions for Euribor and had exchanged information on their trading positions or on their trading or pricing strategies.Ms. Vestager noted what she said was vulgar language used by traders in the case.“Even though it’s Christmas, I don’t think I should complement my green dress with very red cheeks, and I think I would be seriously blushing if I were to repeat any of the wording in some of those chat rooms,” she said.JPMorgan Chase received the largest fine: €337.2 million. Crédit Agricole was penalized €114.7 million and HSBC €33.6 million. The banks have up to two years to appeal. Any appeal would be heard by the European Union’s General Court.“We have cooperated fully with the European Commission throughout its five-year investigation,” JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. “We did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the Euribor benchmark. We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts.”Crédit Agricole also said that it would appeal the fine, adding that it "firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law.”HSBC said it “did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel” and was “reviewing the European Commission’s decision and considering our legal options.”The European investigation is one of several around the world that have found evidence that traders at banks benefited from falsely reported rates.Inquiries by American, British and other regulators into manipulation of Euribor and the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor, have ensnared a number of large global institutions. Eleven people face criminal charges in Britain related to the manipulation of Euribor.Follow Chad Bray @Chadbray and James Kanter @jameskanter on Twitter.Advertisement
