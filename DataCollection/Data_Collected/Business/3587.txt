For a while, a few years ago, there was a weekly video on the New York Times website called The Sweet Spot, taped during off hours in the cafeteria on the 14th floor. The idea was that it would be an informal, incisive discussion of various developments in the world of culture and media. Sometimes it managed to live up to its name, and sometimes it didn’t, but for me the show — or webcast, or schmooze fest, or whatever it was — had a much simpler reason for being: It guaranteed that I would have a few hours a week in the company of David Carr. For anyone who cared about journalism, there was simply no better place to be.David’s public contribution to the profession — his columns and feature stories, his interviews and investigations — is part of the record, and part of the glory of this newspaper. Until his death on Thursday, he covered every corner of the media business (including, sometimes, his own employer) with analytical acumen, ethical rigor and gumshoe tenacity.He managed to see the complexities of digital-age journalism from every angle, and to write about it with unparalleled clarity and wit. His prose was a marvel of wry Midwestern plainness, sprinkled with phrases his colleagues will only ever think of as Carrisms. Something essential was “baked in.” Someone was always competing to be the tallest leprechaun.A series of videos featuring David Carr and A.O. Scott discussing movies and popular culture.That was how David would say he felt when he was singled out for praise. Not that he was modest. He knew his gifts, and was competitive in the way that many of us are — eager for the scoop, the juicy assignment, the front page or the front of the section. But no one was more generous in praise of his colleagues, or happier in their success.AdvertisementAnd though he could be critical of people in the profession (and in the building) whom he suspected of laziness or logrolling, he could shine a dazzling light on anyone he thought was doing the job well.AdvertisementHe could do this in his Media Equation column, celebrating the bravery of war correspondents and muckrakers, and he could do it in the Times elevator or on the patch of West 40th Street where he took his cigarette breaks. If he told you you’d written a heck of a story, you knew he meant it.“What else?” was the question that would punctuate every conversation with him. What were you working on? What did you think of this or that political event, show-business caper or piece of office gossip? How was your family? What were you thinking? This was sincere, friendly curiosity, the expression of a naturally gregarious temperament. But it was also the operation of a tireless journalistic instinct. David was always hungry for stories. He was a collector of personalities and anecdotes, a shrewd and compassionate judge of character. A warrior for the truth.
                A collection of memories and reactions to the death of Mr. Carr, who The Times’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, called “the finest media reporter of his generation.”            I can picture his eyebrows shooting upward at that last sentence. A bit much, maybe. But he regarded the newspaper — and all of its digital, televisual and other cognates — as a big, clanking machine for churning out stories. The only rule was that the stories had to be true.When fishy memoirs of addiction and recovery began floating around in the publishing world, David set out to write his own memoir by applying the rules and techniques of reporting: interviewing sources, checking facts, subjecting his own memory to the scrutiny and skepticism that he brought to every assignment.But he brought compassion too. A streak of Minnesota nice and Irish sentimentality. It was a bit startling to see David Carr emerge, in the wake of Andrew Rossi’s documentary “Page One” and as a consequence of the importance of his beat, as the public face of The Times. It was kind of a beat-up face (though in its way a beautiful one), attached to a gangly, shambling body and speaking in a gravelly, prairie-flat voice.But it was also fitting. David was our champion: the best we had and also the one who would go out into the world every week to make the case for what we do. He understood better than anyone how hard the job can be, how lonely, how confusing, how riddled with the temptations of cynicism and compromise. And yet he could make it look so easy, and like the most fun you could ever hope to have.Reprinted from Friday’s late editions.
