Schwarzman.Mr. Schwarzman, 68, who helped start Blackstone in 1985, personally took home about $690 million for 2014, a regulatory filing on Friday showed.That amount, which largely consists of dividends and includes profit from personal investments in Blackstone funds, surpassed the roughly $450 million that Mr. Schwarzman received in 2013. It reflected how Blackstone, the largest alternative investment firm, was able to reap significant cash profit from selling its investments in private equity, real estate and other areas.Private equity titans like Mr. Schwarzman stand out even on Wall Street for their prodigious wealth. Because he owns a large stake in Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $12 billion, has been a major beneficiary of the firm’s success in recent years.A rival firm, the Carlyle Group, disclosed on Thursday that its three founders together received about $800 million in 2014, including dividends and personal investment returns.The bulk of Mr. Schwarzman’s earnings in 2014 came in the form of $570.5 million in dividends. He also received $33.5 million in profit and returned capital from his personal investments with Blackstone funds.Mr. Schwarzman’s carried interest, or his share of Blackstone’s investment profit, was $84.8 million for the year. He also received a little more than $600,000 in restricted shares in a publicly traded real estate investment trust.His base salary was a relatively small $350,000. And he did not receive a bonus.Advertisement
