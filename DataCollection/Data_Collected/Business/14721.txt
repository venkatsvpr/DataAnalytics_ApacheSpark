LONDON — Three more asset managers suspended redemptions in their British property funds on Wednesday as concerns mounted about the potential impact that Britain’s decision to leave the European Union would have on the real estate market, particularly on the booming property market in London.Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Henderson Global Investors and Canada Life each temporarily suspended trading in their British property funds, bringing the number of fund managers who have put a hold on customer exits to six since Monday.Redemptions are on the rise as investors look for havens after the surprise outcome of the June 23 referendum on whether to exit the European Union.Uncertainty after the vote has sent the pound tumbling and jostled stock markets around the world. On Wednesday, the pound fell to a new 31-year low against the dollar, while the FTSE 100, an index that tracks the biggest stocks traded in London, fell 1.25 percent.AdvertisementThe strain has been particularly acute at property funds in Britain, which promise to provide daily liquidity to investors, but hold assets that are often difficult to sell quickly, like office buildings or shopping centers.AdvertisementBy suspending redemptions, these type of funds want to avoid a cycle of selling that could force them to sell assets at ultralow prices and prompt more investors to seek an exit.In a variation on that approach, Aberdeen Asset Management said late Wednesday that it would cut the value of its British property fund by 17 percent for withdrawal requests that had been made earlier in the day. “This action has been taken due to rapidly changing commercial property market conditions and to continue to provide liquidity in the fund at a price reflecting those conditions,” Aberdeen said in a statement.Adding that it was “mindful of the fact that a 17 percent impact on fund pricing may lead shareholders who have placed redemption orders to reconsider their decision,” Aberdeen said it would suspend trading until noon on Thursday to allow investors to cancel withdrawal requests.Columbia Threadneedle said its portfolio managers maintained a cash balance in its Threadneedle UK Property Authorised Investment Fund to satisfy redemptions because of the time it takes to sell property.The asset manager said it had not been immune to a recent increase in withdrawals by retail investors, but had still been able to meet redemption requests with the fund’s cash on hand.“However, it is expected that these requests to sell will continue for the time being due to uncertainty in the market following the U.K. referendum result, therefore the temporary suspension of dealings allows sufficient time for the orderly sale of assets and protects the interests of all investors,” Columbia said in a statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

According to a recent Bank of England report, these funds have about $46 billion in assets under management, representing 7 percent of investment in the British market.Henderson said it was suspending redemptions in its Henderson UK Property Authorised Investment Fund and its feeder fund because of “exceptional liquidity pressure” after the referendum. The fund was worth about 3.9 billion pounds at the end of May.“The portfolio remains well positioned in core properties with high-quality tenants, with the managers continuing to focus on delivering an attractive income stream,” Henderson said in a news release.Henderson said the suspension in redemptions did not apply to its Henderson Horizon range of property securities funds.Canada Life said Wednesday that it was temporarily deferring client redemptions in four funds: the Canlife Property Life Fund, the Canlife Property Pension Fund, the Canlife UK Property Life Fund and the Canlife UK Property Pension Fund. The funds are worth about £450 million.“Deferring requests to withdraw allows us to protect the interests of all investors in the property fund, including those who plan to remain invested for the medium to long term,” a Canada Life representative said.A version of this article appears in print on July 7, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: 3 More Property Funds Stop Withdrawals After ‘Brexit’ Vote.
