Computers stuffed with superfast chips are going everywhere: home appliances, cars, smartphones and giant data centers. This creates rich opportunities for makers of semiconductors, vastly increasing the number of places they can sell ever-smaller chips.But even as the demand for chips expands, the business has become ruinously expensive for all but the biggest players, and that is causing a multibillion-dollar frenzy.A case in point: On Monday, Intel, the world’s largest maker of chips, said it would pay $16.7 billion for a chip company called Altera.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., hopes to pick up customers, flexibility and a way to keep its manufacturing going at full speed. Altera was losing profitability, in part from higher development and sales costs.AdvertisementIt was the latest in a series of big mergers in the business, pointing to a consolidation, particularly among American manufacturers that came up making chips for things like personal computers and basic networks.AdvertisementLast week, Avago Technologies agreed to pay $37 billion for Broadcom. Both companies work primarily in chips for communications, including networking and smartphones. And in March, a company called NXP Semiconductors paid $11.8 billion for Freescale Semiconductor, which began life as part of Motorola and specializes in chips for sensors and cars.Last October, apparently deciding it could no longer afford the increasingly high cost of making chips, IBM agreed to pay $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries to take over its manufacturing. Big Blue had also announced it would invest $3 billion in semiconductor research.“This consolidation is driven by economics,” said Stacy Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer. “You need to have large scale to build your own factories and create these incredibly small products.”Blame it on Gordon Moore, or at least the law named after the Intel co-founder’s observation that the power of semiconductors, the brains of computing, tends to double every two years or so with no added cost to the buyer.
                Recent months have seen a flurry of deals in the semiconductor sector, a business that has become prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest players.            Moore’s Law has been with us for decades and that computing has advanced at about the pace Mr. Moore anticipated is why we are now shifting from a world of personal computers to a world of computing intelligence everywhere.Intel’s first chip, in 1971, had 2,300 transistors, the gates that process the ones and zeros of software. Its newest model for servers has almost 5.6 billion, more than two million times the number of transistors.That small and dense package, delivered at a modest increase in cost, is how Google can expend on a single Internet search as much computing power as put men on the moon. While traditional corporate computer systems were considered necessary expenses rather than a way to make money, Google and Facebook have made data centers into profit-making factories that need almost constant upgrades.AdvertisementBut building a new chip fabrication facility can easily cost more than $5 billion, limiting it to all but a handful of companies.Ten years ago, Mr. Smith noted, there were more than a dozen companies both designing and making their own chips. “Now it’s us and Samsung,” the large Korean company, he said. “They do it because they make a lot of memory, for us it’s servers and client products,” or personal computers.Companies like Altera, Avago and Broadcom have tried to hold down costs by outsourcing their manufacture to specialist chip foundries, primarily in Taiwan. But just drawing up plans for a product with so many tiny parts has substantial costs.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Solving weird and challenging physics problems at this small size requires a lot of expensive equipment. That’s why there’s all this M.&A.”Besides gaining so-called economies of scale, Intel hopes Altera puts it in better shape for two of the biggest emerging markets, large data centers and the so-called Internet of Things, or computer-enriched machines that work with other devices.A vast complex of chips and sensors constantly feeds and is being fed by globe-spanning systems with millions of servers, from the likes of Amazon and Facebook, in a system that is expected to grow much bigger in the next few years.Altera’s primary chips help Intel target that market. The San Jose, Calif., company’s chips can be reprogrammed once they leave the foundry, altering some of their functions. Intel’s semiconductors are more powerful, but lack that flexibility.By combining the two types on a single chip, Intel thinks that by late next year it can start offering its big business customers ways of fine-tuning performance to suit specific needs.Half of the chips Intel sells to the biggest providers of cloud computing services  are already custom, and the new design could give the customers greater choice at a lower cost to Intel.Advertisement“Intel has 90 percent of the server business into clouds,” Mr. Hung said. “They want to keep them, not give them ideas about building their own chips.”Mr. Smith said the more flexible design would also be handy for customers in the Internet of Things, like automakers, manufacturers and retailers. “You have a lot of different industries, with different workloads,” he said. “We can make it cost competitive.”Also, Intel has fallen behind another big chip company, Qualcomm, in the market for low-powered chips that run mobile devices even as sales of chips for personal computers have slowed. For Intel, improving what it can do in newer, growing sectors is essential.Intel and Altera held talks this year. Further discussions had been delayed, however, when Altera rejected an earlier offer by Intel, according to people briefed on the talks. Since then, Altera reported first-quarter net income that was almost 20 percent below year-earlier levels, and projected lower sales.Under the terms of the transaction, Intel would pay $54 a share in cash for Altera. That represents a premium of about 56 percent to where Altera was trading on March 26 before reports of merger talks emerged.Shares of Altera closed Monday up 5.8 percent. Intel shares were down about 1.6 percent.For all the consolidation among the old guard, Intel and other chip makers face the prospect of new players that will emerge for the new world of computing. Later this week, Hewlett-Packard is supposed to give an update on a supposedly revolutionary kind of computer server designed specifically for large data centers.It expects to introduce the system, called the Machine, possibly as early as 2016.And in late 2014, China announced it would spend almost $5 billion on a fund for homegrown semiconductor makers and fabrication plants.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on June 2, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Intel in Deal for Altera, a Rival Chip Maker.
