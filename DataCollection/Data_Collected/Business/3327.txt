The proposed merger of OneWest Bank and the CIT Group faces a new and somewhat rare regulatory hurdle.Federal banking regulators have scheduled a public hearing for later this month to collect information as part of their review of OneWest’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Friday.The regulators are also gathering information about the “needs of the communities” that will be affected by the merged bank.For months, the California Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit group, has been calling for a public hearing about the merger after raising concerns about OneWest’s foreclosures practices.“We’re hopeful this hearing won’t be a dog and pony show followed by a rubber-stamp approval of the merger,” Kevin Stein, associate director of the coalition, said in a statement.Formerly known as IndyMac bank, an aggressive subprime mortgage lender, OneWest was acquired by a group of private equity and hedge fund investors after it collapsed in 2008. As part of that acquisition, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation agreed to share many of the bank’s losses that were largely driven by IndyMac’s risky mortgage lending.In July, CIT said it would acquire OneWest, paying $3.4 billion in cash and stock. A commercial lender that was felled by its own problems during the financial crisis and rehabilitated under the helm of the longtime Wall Street executive John Thain, CIT covets OneWest’s large base of deposits.The last hearing that the Fed held about a bank merger involved ING and Capitol One in 2011.  The hearing on the OneWest-CIT merger is scheduled for Feb. 26 at the Fed’s offices in Los Angeles.Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached.
