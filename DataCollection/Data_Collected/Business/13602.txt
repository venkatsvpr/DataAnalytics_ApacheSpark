LONDON — Adidas said on Wednesday that it was seeking to sell parts of its golf business including TaylorMade, one of the world’s best-known brands of golf equipment.The German sportswear maker began a strategic review last year of its golf business, announcing that it had hired an investment bank to explore options for the business, which has struggled in recent years to gain momentum.On Wednesday, Adidas, which is based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, said that its executive board had concluded the review and had decided to enter “concrete negotiations with interested parties” to sell parts of its golf division.Adidas said that it would actively seek a buyer for its TaylorMade, Adams and Ashworth brands and would instead focus on golf footwear and apparel sales through its Adidas golf brand.Advertisement“TaylorMade is a very viable business,” Herbert Hainer, the Adidas chief executive, said in a news release. “However, we decided that now is the time to focus even more on our core strength in the athletic footwear and apparel market.”AdvertisementA final decision on selling the business, including any potential agreement, is subject to approval by Adidas’s supervisory board.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
