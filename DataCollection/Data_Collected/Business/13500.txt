LONDON — The International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways, said on Friday that it would trim its growth plans this year to adjust for weaker demand in the second quarter, as fewer people flew after last month’s attacks in Brussels.Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines, said that the group, whose portfolio also includes Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, would cut its plans for capacity growth in 2016 to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent.The Brussels attacks of March 22, which included explosions in the departure hall of Brussels Airport, have curbed appetite for travel, the group said.“The trends going into the third quarter, however, appear to be back to normal,” Mr. Walsh told reporters on a call on Friday, saying he expected that quarter to be “strong.”AdvertisementThat is when International Airlines tends to make its biggest share of annual profit, as many Europeans go on vacation.AdvertisementThe group maintained its forecast for 2016 profit, however, saying that a plan to cut costs, excluding fuel, by about 1 percent this year would help it reach its target.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
