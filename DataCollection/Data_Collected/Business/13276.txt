Michael Strahan is trading one morning show for another: He’s leaving ABC’s “Live With Kelly and Michael” for “Good Morning America.”Mr. Strahan starts in September, and will serve as co-anchor on “G.M.A.,” the network announced on Tuesday.The former football star replaced Regis Philbin in 2012 to co-host “Live” with Kelly Ripa, and represented a stabilizing force for a valuable ABC programming asset.Now he may be tasked with helping to stabilize “Good Morning America.” The ABC morning show still outpaces “Today” by an average of 240,000 viewers (it averages nearly five million viewers) but the NBC show is winning for the season in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic that is important to advertisers.AdvertisementMr. Strahan has served as a correspondent on “Good Morning America” for the last two years. He will continue to serve as an analyst on Fox’s pregame show for pro football.The president of ABC News, James Goldston, said in a statement: “Over the past two years on ‘G.M.A.,’ Michael’s proven to be a tireless and versatile broadcaster with an incredible ability to connect with people, from veterans and all kinds of newsmakers to a host of modern American cultural icons.”AdvertisementMr. Goldston added, “He will help us drive forward into a very exciting future.”The network also said it would search for Mr. Strahan’s successor on “Live” beginning in the fall, after he departs.A version of this article appears in print on April 20, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: After 4 Years ‘Live’ With Ripa, Strahan Is Heading to ‘G.M.A.’.
