Redstone confirmed on Tuesday the appointment of two new members to his irrevocable trust, which will control the future of his companies, as well as new directors to National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which he controls his $40 billion media empire.The individuals have close ties to his daughter, Shari Redstone, and have been characterized by Viacom executives as evidence of her manipulation of her father, who is 92 and in poor health.Named to the trust, which will control his companies after he dies or is declared not competent, are Thaddeus Jankowski, the general counsel of National Amusements, and Jill Krutick, a former media executive. Ms. Krutick was also named to the board of National Amusements, along with Ms. Redstone’s daughter, Kimberlee Ostheimer.“This is my trust and my decision,’’ Mr. Redstone said in a statement, through a spokesman. “I have picked those who are loyal to me and removed those who are not.”The development comes after two of Mr. Redstone’s longtime confidants were ousted from their positions on the trust and the board of National Amusements. Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, and George Abrams, a longtime Viacom director, filed a lawsuit on Monday challenging the moves and questioning Mr. Redstone’s competency.Shortly after, Mr. Redstone filed a petition asking that a Los Angeles court declare his decisions valid.Advertisement
