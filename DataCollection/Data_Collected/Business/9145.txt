HOUSTON —  The Obama administration announced on Tuesday that the greater sage grouse, a flamboyant bird that roams across 11 Western states, does not warrant a listing as an endangered species, an action that could have damaged oil and natural gas interests and the economies of many local communities.The decision brought to a climax a multiyear scramble by federal and state officials, energy companies and ranchers to find ways to protect and extend fragile breeding grounds for the bird, best known for its courtship strut, while sustaining economic development that threatens its habitat.Federal officials described the efforts to avert a listing as the most complex and complete land conservation plan ever developed to arrest the decades-long decline of the chickenlike bird, including mapping of nesting sites and migration corridors for protection from power lines and roads; measures to avert and fight fires that threaten sage grass habitat; and directing oil and gas companies to use directional drilling to avoid areas sensitive for bird survival.The plans establish buffer zones around areas where male grouse gather for breeding, many of which are close to or inside oil and gas fields.AdvertisementEnvironmentalists were divided over whether the measures went far enough to protect the bird from eventual extinction or were simply a sellout to business interests.Advertisement“This is truly a historic effort,” Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said at a ceremony with several governors and other federal officials at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge outside Denver. “It demonstrates that the Endangered Species Act is an effective and flexible tool and a critical catalyst for conservation.”The decision stemmed from a determination in 2010 by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service that the bird was in need of protection. But after study, officials decided that the number of birds and the extent of habitat are sufficient to assure its survival.Some environmentalists disagree, saying that studies show there is a strong probability that the critical sage grouse population in the Powder River basin of Wyoming and Montana will drop below minimal viability thresholds within 30 years. They say limitations on oil and gas drilling are insufficient to protect habitat, and they insist that electricity generation lines currently awaiting approval would be exempted from habitat protections.“It’s a sign that politics as usual has taken over the process,” said Erik Molvar, director of the WildEarth Guardians’s Sagebrush Sea Campaign.A conservation effort across the West to protect the sage grouse, a bird with an unusual mating call, has put different environmental interests at odds.An endangered species listing would have curtailed wind projects and coal mining, as well as drilling. Western governors and energy companies have lobbied hard against a blanket protection of sage grouse habitat, which covers 173 million acres.But Obama administration officials said that the collective efforts to plan protections for the bird’s habitat were sufficient to save the species and not risk extinction for the foreseeable future.Once abundant in at least 13 Western states and three Canadian provinces, the greater sage grouse has declined in number by as much as 80 percent over the past century. Much of the blame comes from loss of habitat to the spread of suburbs, ranching, hunting and wild fires, which have worsened over time, in part because of climate change. Vulnerable to predators like eagles and coyotes, the grouse depends on vast expanses of sagebrush for food and shelter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

About half the habitat, generally drier lands at higher altitudes where the birds mate and nest, is on federal lands managed by the Interior Department. The rest is on state and private lands, particularly wetter meadows essential for the young chicks to mature.AdvertisementThe conflict between some environmentalists and officials who want to protect industry has echoed the battle over logging in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s to save the spotted owl. But the administration and state officials have sought to bring environmental groups like the National Audubon Society into the fold to develop compromise plans to protect the bird and businesses.Court challenges to the compromise efforts are likely. Some Republicans and industry groups complained that the land management plans will unnecessarily harm commercial interests.“With the stroke of a pen, the Obama administration’s oppressive land management plan is the same as a listing” of the bird as an endangered species, said Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, the Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.Brian Rutledge, an Audubon Society vice president, praised the effort as an “unprecedented” cooperation of the states, the federal government and environmental groups. “We have gotten attention paid to an ecosystem that was at best forgotten and at worst being destroyed by the way it was being managed,” he said, “and we are seeing that turned about.”Energy companies also joined the effort to protect their rights to drill and mine.Chesapeake Energy ordered its contracted truckers to drive to their wells only in daylight hours, so as not to disturb the bird’s customary breeding at dawn and nesting at night in one new Wyoming field. Shell Oil developed seed mixtures to bolster the heartiness of vegetation that nourishes the sage grouse and gives chicks better cover from predators. Cloud Peak Energy jury-rigged an ingenious tool out of old mining drag lines to suppress cheatgrass before it can ruin the bird’s natural habitat, and it voluntarily passed on its invention to competing coal companies and ranchers.“Today’s decision validates that we can work together to find solutions,” said Paul Ulrich, the regulatory director at Jonah Energy, an oil and gas company. “We’ve already seen a shift by industry as our knowledge about the greater sage grouse has improved.”A version of this article appears in print on September 23, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Rules Grouse Is Not Endangered, in Environment-Business Accord .
