Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, on Monday also seemed to ease some worries about the economy, while underscoring the view that the Fed may be in no rush to raise rates.“The big story for the market right now is, Do we break out to all-time highs?” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at Northstar Wealth Partners in West Hartford, Conn.“If we do so in the near term, we could see a rush of money jump into the market from investors who had been sitting out on the sidelines, in fear of missing out on further market gains.”Biogen tumbled 12.8 percent to $252.86 after its multiple sclerosis drug failed in a midstage study.Alexion dropped 10.9 percent to $138.13 after its drug failed a trial, while the drug company Valeant slumped 14.6 percent to $24.64 after cutting its full-year forecast.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.72 percent, from 1.74 percent late on Monday.Advertisement
