El País, Spain’s largest daily, warned its staff this year that it was considering a similar move.Last week, The New York Times announced a major restructuring of its own global print editions to focus on digital platforms. The move, which involves the closing of the Paris-based editing and print production operation of The Times’s international editions, will result in the elimination of around 70 jobs. It comes alongside plans to invest $50 million over the next three years to grow its international digital audience.The New Day, which printed five days a week, was originally available only at newsstands and sold for 50 pence, or about 70 cents, a copy. Although the company used social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to promote its content, none of it was available online.Circulation reportedly fell from around 150,000 copies a day in early March to as low as 30,000 by last month. Although it had initially shunned subscriptions, The New Day experimented with a paid “e-edition” via a mobile app in mid-April, but that failed to generate significant sales, Ms. Holloway said.Analysts said the main challenge for The New Day was changing the habits of readers, who have become used to a cornucopia of free content online, as well as the convenience of being able to read it on mobile phones and other devices.In the end, Ms. Holloway said, “it proved too big of an ask to get a critical mass of people to change their behavior frequently enough to make it viable.”Nick Tjaardstra, a deputy director of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers in Frankfurt, described The New Day as a “brave mass-market pitch,” but he stopped short of saying that its failure pointed to the inevitable demise of print.“U.K. papers like The Mail and The Telegraph that have a clearly defined audience, which has not yet fully migrated to other channels, will continue to sustain very attractive, albeit slowly declining, profits” from print products, Mr. Tjaardstra said in an email, referring to two major daily British newspapers with high circulations.He added, “The interesting takeaway from New Day is that they probably saw the venture as much less risky than a digital-only pitch where their content would have had no paid value and digital ad revenue would have been low without scale or targeting.”Advertisement
