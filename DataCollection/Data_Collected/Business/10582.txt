AdvertisementSupported byBy John KoblinHere’s a rule in today’s ever-changing TV landscape: Big hits are very hard to come by.Here’s another: Netflix only rarely cancels shows.On Monday, however, the streaming service said that it was pulling the plug on “Marco Polo,” its pricey 13th-century drama about the Mongol empire, after only two seasons.Despite devoting billions to original programming, introducing dozens of new TV shows, Netflix has been reluctant to cancel its offerings. It previously pulled “Lilyhammer” and “Hemlock Grove,” and announced in September that “Bloodline’’ would not be returning. Those shows, however, lasted three seasons; “Marco Polo” will not.Netflix — along with the other streaming services like Amazon and Hulu — does not disclose ratings, so it’s difficult to know just how poorly “Marco Polo” fared. But reviews for the series were unkind, and there has been next to no cultural excitement surrounding it.And the series was costly. Originally developed for the cable channel Starz, it was produced by the Weinstein Company, whose co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, once boasted that it would be “one of the most expensive shows ever done for pay TV.”As costs escalated, the series moved over to Netflix, and the production was indeed lavish. With an estimated budget of at least $180 million over two years, the series was filmed in far-flung locations like Italy, Kazakhstan and Malaysia, and received an extensive marketing campaign.In a statement, Mr. Weinstein said: “Netflix has been incredible to give us the room to make a series with a cast true to every principle of diversity. It’s a bold network that allows you to do that and support us in the way that Netflix did.”In the four years that Netflix has been streaming original shows, the service has been in a historic buildup mode that has it outspending every competitor, including HBO and Amazon. Netflix said in October it would spend $6 billion on content in 2017, much of it on original programming.When Netflix landed shows like the Aziz Ansari comedy “Master of None” and the period drama “The Crown,” FX’s chief executive John Landgraf said that the streaming service overwhelmed them with “shock and awe levels of money and commitment” for both projects.But the “Marco Polo” cancellation may be a sign that Netflix will become more selective about endlessly devoting resources to original series. The streaming service has not committed to a second season for its pricey show “The Get Down” (the second half of its first season will debut next year). And it’s unclear how projects like the Chelsea Handler talk show are doing.The streaming service said that it does not disclose ratings because it works on a subscription model, and does not sell advertising to adults under the age of 50, as most TV networks do.Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said earlier this year that “if we were spending a lot of money on shows that people weren’t watching” then subscribers would drop the service.The service has more than 86 million subscribers worldwide.Netflix did get some good news on Monday: Both “The Crown” and “Stranger Things” were nominated for the best drama Golden Globe, filling two of the five nominee slots. Though Netflix series like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black” have garnered numerous nominations, the streaming service is still looking for its first Globe or Emmy for best drama or best comedy.Advertisement
