LONDON — HSBC said on Tuesday that its profit fell 18 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with a year earlier, as uncertainty in the markets hurt its investment banking and wealth management businesses.The lender, which is based in Britain but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, is significantly reshaping its business. It announced plans in June to shed tens of thousands of jobs, to sell underperforming businesses and to shrink its global investment banking business.The quarterly results included $341 million in restructuring charges, as well as $31 million in charges related to its efforts to shield its British retail banking business from the effects of investment banking and other activities in the event of another financial crisis.Banks in Britain must separate their retail operations by 2019. Citing increased regulatory costs, HSBC considered moving its headquarters out of Britain last year but opted in February to keep its headquarters in London.AdvertisementThe quarter also included $17 million in charges related to the disposal of its operations in Brazil. HSBC agreed in August to sell the bulk of its operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco for 17.6 billion Brazilian reais, or about $5.1 billion at current exchange rates.AdvertisementFor the three months that ended March 31, HSBC reported a profit of $4.3 billion, compared with a profit of $5.26 billion in the first quarter of 2015.HSBC reported an adjusted pretax profit of $5.43 billion, which was ahead of analysts’ expectations.
                It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.            “Our first quarter performance was resilient in tough market conditions that affected the entire banking sector,” Stuart T. Gulliver, the HSBC chief executive, said in a news release. “Profits were down against a very strong first quarter of 2015, but we increased market share in many of the product areas that are critical to our strategy.”Revenue declined 6 percent to $15 billion in the first quarter, from $15.9 billion in the same period of 2015.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, was down 4 percent to $7.91 billion in the quarter, from $8.27 billion in the first quarter of 2015.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
