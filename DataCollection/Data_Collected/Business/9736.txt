“From a regulatory standpoint – classic anti-trust analysis – this is kind of a no-brainer,” said James Stewart of The Times, “It’s classic vertical integration.”Opponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don’t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law.Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today’s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.Politicians were piling on this week to criticize the deal, including Donald J. Trump; Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president; and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota. Still to be heard from is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a prominent foe of corporate consolidation.A younger generation of antitrust scholars who are rethinking the nation’s fundamental approach to antitrust law may prove even more influential.Advertisement“Over the last 40 to 50 years, antitrust law has evolved to be almost completely indifferent to vertical mergers,” said Tim Wu, an antitrust and internet expert at Columbia Law School who coined the phrase “net neutrality” and recently wrote “The Attention Merchants” on the advertising business.AdvertisementIn vertical mergers, a company buys a supplier; in horizontal mergers, direct competitors combine.But the new generation harks back to the original trustbusters of the early 20th century, who were most concerned about preventing corporations from gaining too much power.
            If AT&T;’s purchase of Time Warner is completed, the combined company would generate $175 billion a year, based on 2015’s revenue. Wall Street is not hugely enamored with the deal, however. After an initial jump, Time Warner’s stock price has declined, as has AT&T;’s.        2015REVENUETIME WARNER$6 bil.HBOTOTAL: $28.1 bil.TURNER $11Includes TNT, TBSand CNN24th:$86.74WARNER BROS.$13TV, movies andvideo games$4INTERNATIONALStock pricein OctoberCONSUMERMOBILITY$35AT&T;Includes wirelessservicesTOTAL: $146.8 bil.Stock pricein October24th:$36.86ENTERTAINMENTGROUP$35Includes pay TV andhigh-speed internetservices.BUSINESSSOLUTIONSIncludes wireless,voice and dataservices as well asequipment tobusinesses.$71OCT. 24, 2016
“The antitrust system as it stands is focused on prices to consumers, innovation and efficiencies,” Mr. Wu said. “That reflects the triumph of the University of Chicago school of economics. But there’s an older tradition, embodied by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, that says a concentration of too much power in too few hands is bad for democracy and bad for consumers.”Scott Hemphill, an antitrust and intellectual property professor at New York University School of Law, agreed. “Vertical deals rarely get prohibited outright,” he said. “Modern antitrust case law has pretty much kept politics out of the analysis.”“But is antitrust law only about economics, or does enhanced political power play a role?” Mr. Hemphill asked. “Would a combined AT&T and Time Warner put too much power in one company? That’s the big question.”It’s a question AT&T says it is prepared to answer. “If someone is looking for a test case to overturn the time-honored judicial precedents of vertical mergers, this is not the case,” David R. McAtee II, AT&T’s general counsel, told me this week. “What we have here is a classic vertical merger that will benefit consumers in an environment that’s begging for innovation.”Given antitrust precedents, it’s no wonder AT&T and Time Warner would expect regulatory approval, even if they have to accept some conditions imposed by the government. Time Warner is so confident the deal will be approved that it negotiated a paltry breakup fee (by megamerger standards) in the event it’s blocked: just $500 million.At nearly every opportunity, Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, and other architects of the deal have repeated the “vertical” mantra. As Mr. Stephenson told me this weekend, “This is strictly a vertical merger. We’re combining with one of our big suppliers. You’d be hard pressed to find a vertical merger denied by the regulators. They won’t give us a free pass, but we expect that if they have concerns, they’ll impose conditions to address them.”AdvertisementMr. Stephenson is right about that. Time Warner is just one of many content suppliers to AT&T, albeit an important one. Time Warner competes vigorously with other film and television studios, cable networks, and producers of news and entertainment.
                AT&T;, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.            AT&T competes in cable delivery systems, satellite and wireless. While more concentrated than news and entertainment (there are just four major wireless carriers), they are still competitive markets.This isn’t a “horizontal” American Airlines-US Airways merger (which inexplicably passed antitrust review) or even the earlier 21st Century Fox bid, which Time Warner rebuffed in part because of antitrust concerns.Since neither firm competes with the other one, merging the two would have little or no effect on market concentration. And the deal’s architects are promising a bevy of virtues for consumers, from more wireless video access to lower prices.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A Georgetown University Law Center study found 46 vertical enforcement actions in the 20-year period from 1994 to 2013, including a 1994 suit to block AT&T’s acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications, a groundbreaking deal that paved the way for AT&T’s entry into wireless communication. (AT&T completed the merger after reaching a consent decree with the Justice Department.)The proposed Comcast-NBC Universal deal set off an avalanche of criticism from rival media companies and consumer advocates who argued that it consolidated too much power in one company. In 2011 the Justice Department sued to block the deal on grounds it had the potential to disadvantage competitors that delivered video services, such as satellite broadcasters and telecom companies, and emerging online video providers like Netflix.In an opinion that has no doubt been closely scrutinized by AT&T’s antitrust lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a federal judge ruled that the conditions Comcast accepted to ease the regulator’s concerns “will provide a prompt, certain and effective remedy for consumers by diminishing Comcast’s ability” to “harm competition.”AdvertisementWhether that has indeed been the case will no doubt be the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators. “It’s important to assess how well the NBC consent decree has done,” Mr. Hemphill said. “On the face of things, online video seems to be thriving. But has Comcast engaged in troubling behavior as a result of owning NBCUniversal? That’s an important question for thinking about this deal.”Susan P. Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School and author of “Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,” was an influential voice in encouraging regulators to oppose the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. She predicted the same fate for AT&T-Time Warner.“I think this is unlikely to be approved,” she said. “There were very few public benefits to the Comcast/NBCU deal, which should not have gone through. It’s difficult even to identify a public benefit for this one.”Mr. McAtee of AT&T said it would “be fundamentally inconsistent and unfair” for the government to reject AT&T’s deal for Time Warner after it approved the Comcast NBC Universal merger.“We feel we have an even stronger case,” he added. “Comcast was a dominant, entrenched cable and broadband provider, and NBC Universal had big broadcast licenses in an ecosystem where over-the-top video was still in its infancy. Yet the government approved the deal with conditions. On all counts, we have a stronger case for approval.”AT&T and Time Warner executives will have many months to make their argument to consumers, Congress, regulators and the White House. But there’s a risk they will find themselves in the midst of a revolution in antitrust thinking that transcends any one case.“It’s interesting that both presidential candidates have said they’d take a close look at this,” Mr. Wu said. “So one of the first tests for the new president will be where they come down on this: Will it be Louis Brandeis or the University of Chicago?”A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Why a Merger of Media Firms That Should Be a Sure Bet Isn’t.
