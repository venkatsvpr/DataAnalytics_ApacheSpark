Philips combined the lighting and LED components operations into a stand-alone company in 2014.Philips said in October that the closing of the deal was “uncertain” after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body that includes representatives from the Treasury and Justice Departments, raised “unforeseen concerns” about the deal.GO Scale Capital has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and California. It has said that its goal is to “scale up its investments in China for global markets.”On Friday, Philips said that it had been unable to gain regulatory clearance despite “extensive efforts” by both companies to mitigate the concerns of the United States authorities.“I am very disappointed about this outcome as this was a very good deal for both Lumileds and the GO Scale Capital-led consortium,” Frans van Houten, the Philips chief executive, said in a news release. “We will now engage with other parties that have expressed an interest in exploring strategic options for Lumileds to pursue more growth and scale.”Lumileds posted sales of about $2 billion in 2015. It has operations in more than 30 countries and about 8,800 employees worldwide.GO Scale Capital said on Friday that it had been “very transparent” with regulators over its commercial interests in investing in technology for sustainable development.“Moving forward, we are not deterred from our goal of building the world’s leading LED lighting company; and China will inevitably become the leader of the global LED industry because of its industrial ecosystem and competitive advantages in scale and cost,” Sonny Wu, the GO Scale Capital chairman, said in a news release.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Philips, which is based in Amsterdam, would have retained 19.9 percent of the business. It would have received $2.8 billion in cash and a deferred contingent payment of up to $100 million. The deal had valued the business at about $3.3 billion in total.Philips said on Friday that it would not have to pay a breakup fee for terminating the deal.The planned sale was part of a continuing effort by Philips to restructure its operations to focus on growth areas.Philips said the deal’s end would have no impact on its plans to spin off another lighting business, known as Lighting Solutions.Advertisement
