Jazz agreed to acquire Gentium, an Italian biopharmaceutical company that develops treatments for rare diseases, in a deal valued at about $1 billion in 2013.Under the terms of the new agreement, Jazz, which is based in Dublin, would pay $30.25 a share for Celator, the Ewing, N.J., maker of Vyxeos, a treatment for a form of leukemia. That would be a 73 percent premium on Celator’s closing price on Friday of $17.53 a share.“Celator Pharmaceuticals is a strong strategic fit with Jazz Pharmaceuticals,” Bruce Cozadd, the Jazz chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “Vyxeos will further diversify our product portfolio, and is complementary to our clinical and commercial expertise in hematology/oncology.”Vyxeos has been granted so-called orphan drug status by regulators in Europe and the United States for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Orphan drugs, which target rare diseases that would otherwise not be profitable to treat, are eligible for fast-track approval, tax breaks and several years of market monopoly.The transaction is subject to investors agreeing to sell a majority of Celator’s outstanding shares to Jazz, as well as to regulatory approval. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.Investors holding about 18.4 percent of Celator’s shares, including its executive officers and directors, have agreed to sell their shares.Jazz reincorporated in Ireland in 2012, after a tax inversion deal with Azur Pharma.Tax inversions have been popular with drug makers and other American companies looking to lower their corporate tax rates and to gain better access to cash held by overseas subsidiaries. But the deals have faced resistance from the United States government.In April, the Treasury Department, in conjunction with the Internal Revenue Service, announced a series of new rules intended to curtail the practice. The changes have scuttled several planned inversions, including Pfizer’s $152 billion merger with Allergan.“The planned combination of Jazz and Celator is highly complementary,” Scott Jackson, the Celator chief executive, said. “After thoroughly evaluating our strategic options, our board of directors has unanimously determined that this all-cash transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders.”Jazz was advised by RBC Capital Markets and the law firm Cooley, while MTS Health Partners and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis advised Celator.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
