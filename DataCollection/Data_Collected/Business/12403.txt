That data will then be exchanged among the 28 member states.The European Union deal goes beyond international guidelines approved by the Group of 20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Those guidelines do not force subsidiaries of foreign countries to disclose the tax data of their parent group, whereas the European Union rules will affect foreign multinationals that have subsidiaries in the bloc, officials said.Because of concerns expressed by Germany and some other European Union countries that the measures could scare away foreign investors, the new rules will be mandatory for foreign companies beginning next year.The rules are expected to be formally adopted by June, Mr. Dijsselbloem said. The unanimous approval of all the member states is required.Despite misgivings from some governments, the European Union tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici is considering proposing bolder provisions in the coming weeks to make company tax data available to the public, not just to state administrations.Advertisement
