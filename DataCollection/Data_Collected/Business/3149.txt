FRANKFURT — Consumer prices in the 19-country eurozone fell in January for a second consecutive month, compared with a year earlier, according to data released Friday.Together, the data reinforce fears that the region could lapse into a sustained period of sluggish or falling prices that could lead to an even higher jobless rate and economic stagnation.But among economists there is a divergence of opinion about whether the fears are justified. Some say the 19 nations in the currency bloc have been in de facto deflation for months. Others say falling prices are a boon for consumers and no reason for panic.Deflation — a vicious cycle of declining business revenue, sagging wages and rising joblessness — has been a marker of economic disaster. The United States had deflation during the Great Depression. Germany had deflation just before Hitler took over. Japan is still trying to escape a vicious deflationary circle that began in the 1990s.AdvertisementFear of worryingly low inflation was a big reason the European Central Bank recently decided to begin a big program of bond buying, in hopes of stimulating the eurozone economy and nudging inflation closer to its target of just below 2 percent.Advertisement”The average citizen in the world does not understand the consequences of what deflation is,” Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, in investment fund, said recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “It’s the Darth Vader death star outside of the atmosphere of the Earth shooting a laser to blow up the world.”Other economists say that the current modest decline of prices in the eurozone, caused largely by plunging oil prices, is benign — and even beneficial. ”Deflation is one of the most abused terms in economic history,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist of Commerzbank in Frankfurt.He said that falling wages and prices in countries like Greece and Spain were helping to restore them to international competitiveness. And price declines have effectively raised the disposable incomes of eurozone consumers by 1 percent. “This is positive deflation,” he said.On Friday, the European Union statistics bureau, Eurostat, said consumer prices fell by 0.6 percent in January after a decline of 0.2 percent in December. A nearly 9 percent drop in the oil prices and other energy costs accounted for most of the decline.What alarmed some economists, though, was a low in the eurozone’s so-called core inflation rate, which does not count things like energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, whose prices often fluctuate greatly.Although prices as measured by core inflation did not actually fall, the rate of increase dipped in January to a level that economists consider worrisomely low — 0.6 percent, down from 0.7 percent in December.
            Consumer prices in the eurozone fell by 0.6 percent in January from a year earlier, matching the decline of July 2009, during the financial crisis.

When consumer spending falls, companies earn less revenue and face pressure to dismiss workers or cut wages, creating a vicious circle of declining economic activity.It was that risk that helped prompt the European Central Bank to announce on Jan. 22 that it would spend 1.1 trillion euros, or $1.24 trillion, through September 2016 buying eurozone government bonds and other assets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Now, he said Friday, he has become more optimistic.”What we have now is really a powerful monetary expansion,” Mr. Micossi said. “It comes at the right time. The fall of the economy is coming to a halt.”In fact, the unemployment data published Friday provided a glimmer of good news. The jobless rate in the eurozone dipped to 11.4 percent in December after coming in at 11.5 percent in November, according to Eurostat. Economists had expected the rate to stay at 11.5 percent.In all 28 countries in the European Union, unemployment fell to 9.9 percent from 10 percent, the first time it was in single digits since October 2011.The eurozone has experienced periods of falling prices before. Consumer prices fell for five months in 2009, during the global financial crisis, with a 0.6 percent decline in July of that year, compared with a year earlier. But inflation returned and rose quickly as the eurozone began to recover.The current bout of falling prices, though, comes after six years of weak growth, and many economists are pessimistic about the prospect of a quick recovery. Despite modest progress, countries like France and Italy need to do more to improve economic performance, many say, such as revising labor laws or streamlining approval procedures for businesses.In addition, countries that have healthy government budget surpluses, like Germany, have been reluctant to spend more on public works to stimulate growth. Germany’s unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in December, was the lowest in the eurozone.AdvertisementMany economists say that the central bank stimulus, which will involve buying 60 billion in eurozone assets each month starting in March, will be of little use unless governments do their part by creating conditions for better job creation.That is also a common refrain among business executives like Maximilian Zimmerer, chief financial officer of German insurer Allianz. Mr. Zimmerer said eurozone countries needed to do more to become competitive.“There are still a lot of reforms to be done,” Mr. Zimmerer said in an interview. “That’s for sure.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
