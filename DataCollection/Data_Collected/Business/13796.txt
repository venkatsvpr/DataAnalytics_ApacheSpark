Summers, the former Treasury secretary and former Harvard University president.The disclosure of a criminal subpoena, which the company received last Monday — the day it announced Mr. Laplanche’s departure — is another big blow to Lending Club. Once considered the pioneer in its field, Lending Club is now fighting to defend the soundness of its business model.Even before the internal problems became public, Lending Club and other marketplace lenders had been having trouble selling their loans because of growing doubts about the long-term viability of their business.Marketplace lending — which is fast and efficient — had been considered a potential disruptive force to the banking establishment, but now some analysts question whether it can bounce back from the recent turmoil. When it went public in December 2014, Lending Club’s stock closed at $23.43 a share. On Monday, it closed just shy of $4 a share.Advertisement
