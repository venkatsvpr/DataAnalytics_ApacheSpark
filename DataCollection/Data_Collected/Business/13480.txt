The lender, which issued the bonds during the financial crisis to bolster its reserves, also believes the bonds no longer count toward its capital buffer after regulators put in place new rules.The lender said that it also recorded £161 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, as well as £115 million in provisions for litigation and conduct costs.For the three months ended March 31, Lloyds reported a profit of £531 million, compared with £944 million in the first quarter of 2015.“We have delivered a robust financial performance in a challenging operating environment, while making good progress in our strategic initiatives and continuing to help Britain prosper,” António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, said in a news release.On an underlying basis, the bank reported a profit of £2.05 billion in the first quarter, down 6 percent from £2.18 billion in the same period a year earlier.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose 3 percent to £2.91 billion in the quarter, from £2.83 billion in the first quarter of 2015.The British government had hoped to terminate its holdings in Lloyds with an offering to retail investors this spring, but it delayed the sale in January because of turmoil in the financial markets.It was the second time in two years that the government had delayed a retail offering of its Lloyds stake.The government owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds after the lender received a £17 billion bailout, but it has reduced its holdings since September 2013, as the bank’s prospects have improved.Since the government announced plans in October for a retail offering, the Lloyds share price has fallen 13 percent and the stock is trading below the average of 73.6 pence a share that the British government paid for its original holding.Shares of Lloyds fell about 3 percent to 66.9 pence in early trading in London on Thursday.Advertisement
