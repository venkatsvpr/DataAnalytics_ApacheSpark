LONDON — HSBC said on Friday that it had begun the search process for a replacement for Douglas Flint, its chairman.The bank, which is based in London but generates about half of its profit in Asia, said that the nomination committee of its board was leading the search and that it hoped to find a successor by next year.Mr. Flint said the nomination committee would like to have a new chairman in place to lead the search for a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the bank’s chief executive.“The board aims to nominate my successor during 2017, but the exact timing is clearly dependent upon identifying and securing the appropriate candidate” Mr. Flint said in a notice related to HSBC’s annual meeting later this year.Mr. Flint said he would remain as long as necessary to ensure a “smooth transition.”The departures of Mr. Gulliver and Mr. Flint would be the latest in a series of changes to the bank’s board in the last year.In November, HSBC said that Paul Walsh, the former chief executive of Diageo, and Henri de Castries, the chairman and chief executive of AXA, would join its board as independent directors this year.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
