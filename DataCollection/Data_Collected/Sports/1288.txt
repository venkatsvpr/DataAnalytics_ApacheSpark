Remember the spring training dispatch about how Captain Wright wandered into the clubhouse and discovered Syndergaard snacking to his then 22-year-old heart’s content during an intrasquad game?“If there is a young player that is here, there is a reason: They have talent and potential,” Wright said that day after a chat with Syndergaard about where a young pitcher, ticketed to begin the season in the minors, belonged at that moment — on the bench with the other wannabes. “I would encourage them to use this chance to take every opportunity to learn from it.”What we glean from the Mets with thrilling regularity night after postseason night is that the once-entrenched sense of fatalism at Citi Field is increasingly futile, obscured or even overwhelmed by talent, potential and the opportunity created from the apparent realization that their time may really, truly be now.Wright’s run-scoring and slump-eviscerating double to deep center field off Jake Arrieta drove in the first of three first-inning runs, which were all Syndergaard and the Mets’ bullpen needed to subdue the Cubs in a 4-1 Game 2 victory Sunday night and take a two-games-to-none lead in the National League Championship Series.Heading home to Wrigley Field, the Cubs may need to sweep the three games in Chicago to have a chance.“I’d like 15 degrees more Fahrenheit, might help a little bit,” Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said.Yes, the temperature is supposed be better at Wrigley and no, it was not ideal hitters’ weather Sunday night, when the game, of course, had to be played so those clever baseball marketers could match their premier series against an N.F.L. reunion of Tom Brady and the Indianapolis Colts. But if a team from Chicago found it a little too blustery to hit in New York, Maddon’s young men may be suffering more from a deflated ego than the potential hand-stinging treacheries of October.After Curtis Granderson punched a single into right field through the infield shift leading off the home first against Arrieta (regular-season earned run average: 1.77), Wright crushed a ball to center in the swirling wind beyond Dexter Fowler, scoring Granderson.That brought up Daniel Murphy in a scene that seemed lifted straight from the “The Natural.”On an early swing on a breaking ball down, Murphy, with an exaggerated follow-through, stroked a long fly that drifted to the wrong side of the right-field foul pole, evoking many thoughts of hah, hah, he almost did it again.A couple of pitches later, Murphy did it again, his fifth home run of the postseason on the happy side of the pole. And this from a guy who twice in his career as a mostly everyday player hit six for the entire season.It was another breaking ball down, really down. “He hit it off the ground,” Granderson said.Two innings later, Granderson — now hitting .375 in seven postseason games, with an on-base percentage of .448 — reached again leading off, this time with a walk. He stole second while Wright was striking out, and here came Murphy.Maddon had seen enough of this movie. “I didn’t want to mess with it,” he said.He had Arrieta walk Murphy intentionally, playing by the book of lefty-righty percentages, except he was putting another man on base for Yoenis Cespedes and his 105 regular-season runs batted in.“Ces hit 35 bombs this season — I was surprised,” said Murphy, when asked if Maddon’s move was more conventional wisdom or the waving of a white flag in his direction.Cespedes was so mad that he hit a ground ball in the hole for a run-scoring single — after Granderson, who led the Mets in stolen bases with all of 11, took third, a third straight game a Mets base runner has swiped that base.Even as Mets fans enjoy this pinch-me postseason, simmering beneath the surface are fears that Cespedes will soon disappear. But with the way Murphy is going, are they worried about the wrong prospective free agent?After nearly a decade of misery, who can blame them for thinking they are watching a fairy tale as opposed to a team that has dominated with pitching and demonstrated that its lineup may be inferior to no one’s?The series is not over, and we will see what happens at Wrigley. But Cespedes, good as he has been, was only a part of the Mets’ trade-deadline and post-trade-deadline upgrade. The return of Wright and Travis d’Arnaud from injuries, the promotion of Michael Conforto from the minors, the streaky power of Lucas Duda and the realization of Granderson as much more than a beneficiary of the Yankee Stadium right-field porch have all been instrumental in the fashioning of a lineup with excellent length.It is one that has now beaten Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Jon Lester and Arrieta in a little more than a week, the narrative ever changing while the false ones of yesterday continue to fade.Remember when Terry Collins was no more than a caretaker, not a manager for the long haul? When Sandy Alderson was a general manager long past his prime? When the Mets were sunk by the spring drug suspension of closer Jenrry Mejia? When even after their surge they were supposedly only capable of beating bad teams?When, seemingly 20 minutes ago, Matt Harvey was selfish and a big-game choke artist to boot?Alongside Syndergaard, Wright was asked about this October, and this is what he said:“Yeah, I mean, we’ve beaten some of the best that the game has to offer, but I’ll argue that we have the Syndergaards, the Harveys, the Matzes and the deGroms, so I like our chances when we can run those guys out there. But just an amazing run for us offensively to be able to get to some of these guys early and then allow these starters to go out there.”At the mention of “these guys,” who are his guys, Wright glanced at Syndergaard, with his flowing blond locks falling from under a blue-and-orange wool hat. From balmy Florida to blustery October, how much have we learned about talent, potential and how much the plot can thicken?Advertisement
