But not on Thursday afternoon, when a reflective white sheet of ice stretched between first base and third base for the seventh edition of the Winter Classic, which the Washington Capitals won, 3-2, over the Chicago Blackhawks on a goal by Troy Brouwer with 12.9 seconds remaining.In 2012, there was a two-hour delay to avoid sun glare in Philadelphia, but this game started on time with a temperature of 43.3 degrees, according to the N.H.L.“For us, the primary issue, if there was to be an issue, was player safety,” Commissioner Gary Bettman said. “Once we were comfortable that that wasn’t going to be an issue, everyone decided — I decided — it was time to go and play on time.”Eye black did little to offset the glare, and Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner was the only one to wear sunglasses. The teams switched ends at the 10-minute mark of the first period as shadows from the stands began to cover the ice.AdvertisementAfter a pregame concert by Billy Idol, the teams emerged from a replica of the Capitol — the Blackhawks from the House side, the Capitals on the Senate side — and skated onto a narrow, light blue sheet of ice styled after the Reflecting Pool. After the unfurling of a rink-size flag, there was a flyover from a pair of F-16 fighter jets.  AdvertisementThis was the first Winter Classic contested between teams that had previously played in one. The Blackhawks hosted the second one, in 2009 at Wrigley Field, and the Capitals played at Heinz Field in 2011 against the Penguins. The Blackhawks also hosted Pittsburgh in an outdoor game at Soldier Field last year, as part of the league’s Stadium Series. Alzner admitted that he and some teammates had been lukewarm to the event, but their excitement returned Wednesday when they entered the Nationals’ locker room.“I think we thought that the novelty would be gone leading up to this,” he said. “And then as soon as we got in here, it kind of came back again, and everyone was pretty excited about it. The trainers set everything up so nicely for us here, and all the cool Winter Classic gear that we have to wear, you just feel excited again. You feel like it’s Christmas for us.”The Blackhawks’ captain, Jonathan Toews, said he believed that the repeat invitations to play outdoors were a well-earned reward for his team’s recent success (two Stanley Cup titles in the last five seasons). Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Brandon Saad tied the game by finishing a tick-tack-toe play from Marian Hossa and Toews at 3:15 of the period.  The Capitals neutralized the Blackhawks’ momentum by surviving a five-on-three power play midway through the period, and the game remained tied deep into the third.AdvertisementWith just over three minutes left, Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen was called for a questionable boarding penalty that gave the Blackhaws a last chance to win in regulation. But with only two seconds left on the power play, Toews was called for an equally dubious hooking penalty.When Ovechkin’s stick was broken by a slash as he carried the puck into the neutral zone, the referee’s hand flew up, but before the whistle could be blown, the puck found Brouwer’s stick, and he snapped it past Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford, sending the Capitals’ bench and fans into jubilation.“We started talking about the Winter Classic since we started the season, and this was it,” Ovechkin said. “I remember Brouwer said: ‘It’s a good time to show up and make a show.’ And he did.”Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the Washington Capitals’ 3-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in the N.H.L.'s Winter Classic misstated, in some copies, the given name of the Capitals player who scored the winning goal. He is Troy Brouwer, not Roy.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Battling Sun’s Glare at Ballpark, the Capitals Deliver a Final Bit of Brilliance.
