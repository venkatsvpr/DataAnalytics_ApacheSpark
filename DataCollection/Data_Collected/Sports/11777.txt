CreditAngel Valentin for The New York Times        Wladimir Klitschko, the heavyweight champion of the world, was trying to rescue a news conference that was supposed to be promoting a title bout at Madison Square Garden.Save for a few camera clicks, the room was quiet when he stepped to the microphone.“Guys, you are lame,” Klitschko said, smiling. “We’re not at a funeral.”The line drew a few laughs. Klitschko stretched out his arms and greeted New York the way that he would have liked to be welcomed. Over the next eight minutes, he spoke about his love of New York and the significance of fighting at the Garden. Klitschko, who holds a doctorate in sports science from the University of Kiev, could have been across town at the United Nations delivering an impassioned plea for his native Ukraine.In Europe, Klitschko fights fill soccer stadiums. But he has trouble selling out the Garden despite a 63-3 record with 54 knockouts and 17 successful heavyweight championship defenses, the third-highest career total.AdvertisementKlitschko’s lack of popularity in the United States is not entirely his fault. There has been a dearth of American heavyweight contenders — neither Eddie Chambers nor Tony Thompson, Klitschko’s only opponents from the United States since 2009, is a household name.AdvertisementThen there is Klitschko’s style, which can at times make fencing look more combative. The 6-foot-6 Klitschko breaks down his opponents in the early rounds with his staggering reach. He can pop a powerful jab, but he prefers to tie up his opponents, said Bryant Jennings, Klitschko’s opponent Saturday, a move that transforms his matches into waltzes.“He holds very well,” said Jennings, who is 19-0. “That’s one of the things he does do.”Klitschko’s trainer, Johnathon Banks, doubts that his fighter will ever be recognized as the world’s best pound-for-pound boxer.“The thing that bothers me the most is that the American public will not appreciate what he has done until he’s long retired,” Banks said. “He’s dominated more rounds than any fighter in the top of their division. Any weight class.”Klitschko’s historical standing is not a priority for him right now. In December, he and his fiancée, the actress Hayden Panettiere, had their first child, a daughter, Kaya Evdokia.Then there is the continuing crisis in his home country, where his brother, Vitali, himself a former heavyweight champion, is the mayor of Kiev, the nation’s capital. According to the United Nations, more than 6,100 people have been killed in the Ukraine conflict during the past year.Klitschko said that this trip to New York was, in part, a diplomatic mission.“I’m not a politician,” Klitschko said. “But I understand that I’m part of this society. I understand that this title that I have, one of the most valuable in sports, is my stage — to raise attention to certain problems in society.”Right now, that means turning the focus to his homeland.“There’s a lot of desperation,” Klitschko said. “The bullets are real.”AdvertisementCareer TurnaroundAlong the wall of the Lucky Street Boxing Gym in Hollywood, Fla., the phrase “Blood, Sweat, No Fear” is painted in large, black letters. On a recent Tuesday afternoon, several high-grade fans suspended from the ceiling offered little comfort to those gathered for Klitschko’s daily public training session.Klitschko loves to be around people, and he prefers the background noise of a crowd to the quiet of an empty gym. As Klitschko waited for his workout to begin, his trainer, Banks, stood off to the side.“He’s not the type of guy to lose focus,” Banks said. “You can’t be at the top this long and lose focus. Many things have happened over the past 11 years. He’s on top because he knows what to do.”In 2004, Banks became Klitschko’s chief sparring partner, coming on board after Klitschko’s third loss, a fifth-round technical knockout at the hands of an American, Lamon Brewster.“He was at the bottom,” Banks said of Klitschko. “He was on the canvas.”The broadcaster Jim Lampley said upon the bout’s conclusion, “That may be the end of the Wladimir Klitschko heavyweight contender story.”Instead, Klitschko and Banks got to work under the Hall of Fame trainer Emanuel Steward. Four fights later, Klitschko won the International Boxing Federation championship.When Steward died of colon cancer in 2012, Banks became Klitschko’s trainer.Their dynamic is unusual: Banks, 32, is younger than his pupil and an accomplished fighter. He owns a record of 29-3-1, and in 2012, he ascended to No. 2 in the World Boxing Organization’s heavyweight rankings.Although Banks still fights occasionally, he has switched his focus to training Klitschko.“I’m basically the No. 1 contender, but I’m training the guy,” he said. “I had a job I had to do. I didn’t think about it.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Apart from a collection of Muhammad Ali photos that line one of the walls, this place offers very few hints about what goes on next door.AdvertisementKlitschko, who is fluent in four languages, was being interviewed by a German magazine reporter. Later, he switched to English and spoke about the crisis at home.“A year and a half ago,” he said, “millions of the Ukrainians, and I’m sure Russians as well, would’ve said: ‘A war against our brother folk? This is impossible. This is insane.’ ”Klitschko returned to Kiev in late February and was shaken up as he witnessed firsthand the horrors of war.“You should see the eyes of people when they say, ‘I lost, with one explosion, everything,’ ” he said. “ ‘I lost my house. I lost my car. I lost my children. I lost my wife.’ ”Klitschko speaks daily with his brother about the stress Vitali Klitschko is under as the mayor of Kiev. In a widely reported episode this year, Vitali Klitschko was sprayed with a fire extinguisher while trying to calm down a protest in Kiev’s Independence Square.“It’s a tough job,” Wladimir Klitschko said. “He’s responsible for four million people. That’s a lot of pressure. In these times, if you do nothing, it’s bad. If you do something, it’s bad. You’re in a situation where you have to make decisions.”Klitschko has little desire to join his brother in politics. But he also embraces his status as a statesman of sorts and has spoken out frequently concerning his homeland.“This is an issue that’s not just a Ukraine issue,” he said. “This is protection of the democracy that’s been developed for hundreds of years in the West. And this is protection of the quality of human lives.”AdvertisementKlitschko is confident that there will be peace in the region eventually. He just hopes that it comes before more lives are lost.“I know that the day will come where Russia will say, ‘How can we do that to our own brother folk Ukraine?’ ” he said. “This day will come. The question is, When? And how much is the price?”Signature MomentEach morning at 7:30 comes the sound of Klitschko’s honing the craft that allows him to offer his world views to a wide audience.“I’m not focused when I’m not in the gym,” he said. “But as soon as I get in the gym, the door’s closed. There’s nobody but Jennings and myself.”With 10 knockouts among his 19 victories, Jennings, Klitschko’s 30-year-old opponent from Philadelphia, is considered by most to be a credible opponent, with at least a chance to pull off the upset.A potential matchup that truly piques the interest of fight fans, though, is one between Klitschko and Deontay Wilder of Tuscaloosa, Ala. Wilder, 29, is 33-0 with 32 knockouts and holds the World Boxing Council’s championship belt.Klitschko — a World Boxing Organization, World Boxing Association, and International Boxing Federation champion — said he wanted to face Wilder and perhaps achieve the signature victory that many believe is missing from his résumé.“Am I on the peak of the mountain with my performance?” he said. “I don’t know. I don’t think so.”A version of this article appears in print on April 23, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Fighting for Attention.
