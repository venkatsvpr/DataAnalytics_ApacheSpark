Vikings (6-2) at Raiders (4-4)4:25 p.m. Line: Raiders by 3N.F.L. Week 10 scores and highlightsWith only three picks separating them in the 2014 draft, it is probably inevitable that Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater (the 32nd pick) and Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (36th) will draw comparisons over the course of their careers, and to this point they are the shining stars of that quarterback class. (The two selected ahead of them, Johnny Manziel and Blake Bortles, have not been as successful.) Bridgewater has the Vikings, who have won four straight for the first time since 2012, in a position to win the N.F.C. North, while Carr is having a Pro Bowl season statistically, and a wild-card playoff berth is not an impossibility for Oakland.PICK: RaidersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
