GENEVA —  Members of Russia’s secret service intimidated workers at a drug-testing lab to cover up top athletes’ positive results. They impersonated lab engineers during the Winter Olympics in Sochi last year. A lab once destroyed more than 1,400 samples.Athletes adopted false identities to avoid unexpected testing. Some paid to make doping violations disappear. Others bribed the antidoping authorities to ensure favorable results, and top sports officials routinely submitted bogus urine samples for athletes who were doping.Those allegations were among hundreds contained in a report released Monday by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Across 323 pages, it implicates athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors and various Russian institutions, laying out what is very likely the most extensive state-sponsored doping program since the notorious East German regime of the 1970s.In addition to providing a granular look at systematic doping, the group that drafted the report made extraordinary recommendations, including a proposal that Russia be suspended from competition by track and field’s governing body and barred from track and field events at next summer’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement“It’s worse than we thought,” Dick Pound, founding president of the World Anti-Doping Association and an author of the report, said at a news conference in a Geneva hotel. “This is an old attitude from the Cold War days.”AdvertisementRussian officials responded with defiance, disputing the investigation’s findings. “Whatever we do, everything is bad,” Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister, told the news agency Interfax. “If this whole system needs to shut down, we will shut it down gladly. We will stop paying fees, stop funding the Russian antidoping agency, the Moscow antidoping laboratory. We will only save money.”
                Here is a look at the officials and athletes named in the World Anti-Doping Association’s report on Russian doping.            Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of the Moscow lab whom Monday’s report accused of having solicited and accepted bribes, dismissed the suggestions. “This is an independent commission which only issues recommendations,” he said. “There are three fools sitting there who don’t understand the laboratory.”Mr. Pound said he had presented the group’s findings to Mr. Mutko before they were released publicly. “He’s frustrated to some degree,” he said. “He certainly knew what was going on. They all knew.”The report also recommended that the World Anti-Doping Agency impose lifetime bans on five Russian coaches and five athletes, including the gold and bronze medalists in the women’s 800 meters at the 2012 London Olympics.“The Olympic Games in London were, in a sense, sabotaged by the admission of athletes who should have not been competing,” the report read.Bans from competition are not all that could come of the inquiry. Mr. Pound said the agency had negotiated a cooperation agreement with Interpol and had handed over extensive documents and evidence. Interpol confirmed that cooperation with its own announcement on Monday, noting that related inquiries stretched from Singapore to France.Last week, the French authorities announced that they had opened a criminal investigation into the former president of track and field’s world governing body, Lamine Diack of Senegal, over allegations that he accepted bribes to allow at least six Russian athletes to participate in competitions, including the 2012 Olympics.AdvertisementThe former director of the medical and antidoping division of that governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, is also under investigation, the French authorities said, along with Mr. Diack’s legal adviser.
            In June 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency released its first set of statistics on doping violations. The violations, taken from 2013 data, included 115 countries and 89 sports. Russia had the highest number of violations -- 225 across 30 sports -- with 42 of them coming from track and field events.        ViolationsPCT.

Russian athletes, in soaring numbers, have been caught doping in recent years. Russia had far more drug violations than any other country in 2013 — 225, or 12 percent of all violations globally, according to data from the World Anti-Doping Agency. About a fifth of Russia’s infractions involved track and field athletes, the focus of Monday’s report.“This level of corruption attacks sport at its core,” Richard H. McLaren, a Canadian lawyer and an author of the report, said in an interview Sunday. In contrast to corporate governance scandals like those currently affecting world soccer, he said, drug use by athletes has distorted the essence of professional games. “Bribes and payoffs don’t change actual sporting events,” Mr. McLaren said. “But doping takes away fair competition.”The report released Monday was the result of a 10-month investigation by an independent commission of WADA. Its inquiry stemmed from a December 2014 documentary by the German public broadcaster ARD, which drew on accounts from Russian athletes, coaches and antidoping officials, who said that the Russian government had helped procure drugs for athletes and cover up positive test results.Further allegations emerged in August, when ARD and The Sunday Times of London released another report more broadly covering the leaked results of thousands of international athletes’ blood tests dating to 2001, showing decorated athletes in good standing with suspicious drug tests. Those allegations — which drew significant suspicion to Kenya — are also being investigated by the independent commission, but the results were not included in Monday’s report, as the inquiry is not complete, the agency said.The three-person commission, led by Mr. Pound, also included Mr. McLaren, who teaches law at the University of Western Ontario, and Günter Younger, the head of cybercrime for the police in the German state of Bavaria.WADA’s foundation and executive board will decide whether to act on the commission’s recommendations; they are scheduled to meet next week in Colorado Springs, an event that motivated the timing of the release of the commission’s report, Mr. Pound said.In a statement on Monday, the International Olympic Committee called the report “deeply shocking” and said it trusted the judgment of the I.A.A.F., which would decide whether to bar Russia from competition.Richard W. Pound, a co-author of a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency accusing Russia of running a doping program, spoke on Monday in Geneva on the findings.Mr. Pound did not offer any time frame for the recommended suspension. If Russia did not fight the prescriptions — to enact rigorous and specific drug-testing controls — he said he thought it could be possible for the country’s track and field athletes to compete in the Summer Olympics.Advertisement“If they do the surgery and do the therapy, I hope they can get there,” he said. “That is your nuclear weapon. Either get this done or you are not going to Rio.”The commission also recommended that the Russian antidoping authority be declared non-code-compliant indefinitely; that the director of the Moscow laboratory be removed from his job; and that the lab, which was provisionally banned in 2013, lose its accreditation.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the initial reaction in Russia fell in line with the tradition since Soviet times, with many attributing the revelations to a Western plot to undermine the country’s accomplishments.“It is all connected with the fact that Russian athletes demonstrate such good results, some countries are not satisfied with it,” said Igor Ananskikh, a member of the youth policy and sports committee of the Russian Parliament.Nikolai Valuev, a former Russian heavyweight boxing champion now serving as a deputy in the Parliament, said on the state-run Rossiya 24 television channel: “In recent times, I hear only about investigations of Russian athletes. This has already become a system, too.
                The report described a pervasive doping culture among Russia’s sports programs and implicated athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors and various Russian institutions.            “First of all,” he said, “we must conduct a broad investigation to find out whether the results of the investigation are true.”Days before Monday’s report was published, however, Russia’s athletics federation suspended five athletes, including a noted distance runner, Maria Konovalova.Advertisement“The Russians themselves have said there are vestiges of the old Soviet system, old-guard coaches who haven’t changed and can’t change,” Mr. McLaren said. “The minister of sport says their way of operating is over. But read our report.”Russia has had a particularly prominent place in the international sports spotlight in recent years, hosting not only the Winter Games in Sochi in 2014 but also the track and field world championships in Moscow the year before.The country is scheduled to host the next World Cup, in 2018, although the Swiss authorities are investigating allegations that Russia might have secured the tournament through under-the-table agreements. The Moscow laboratory implicated in Monday’s report is set to oversee testing for FIFA during the World Cup. The lab did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Pound declined to say whether he thought Russia should be stripped of its status as host of that tournament. “I think FIFA’s got to sort out its own difficulties — without our help,” he said.Mr. Mutko, Russia’s sports minister, sits on FIFA’s executive committee.“The credibility of sport has taken some serious body blows in the last month,” Mr. Pound said, referring to the FIFA corruption case and to Monday’s report, which suggested that similar doping violations existed beyond track and field. “Public opinion is going to move toward all sports being corrupt.”Neil MacFarquhar, Ivan Nechepurenko and Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Moscow.A version of this article appears in print on November 10, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Drugs Pervade Russian Sport, Report Alleges.
