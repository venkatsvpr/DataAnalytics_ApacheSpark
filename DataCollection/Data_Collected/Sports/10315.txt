CLEVELAND —  After Thursday night’s game, an 81-70 victory over Wichita State, several of Notre Dame’s tired but satisfied players sat in their locker room watching the tense ending of the Wisconsin-North Carolina matchup.Although several players expressed something close to disinterest, the sophomore Austin Torres said he was pulling for North Carolina. “I always root for the A.C.C.,” he said.In just its second year in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Notre Dame won the league tournament by beating Duke and North Carolina in Greensboro, N.C., with one of Division I’s best offenses. That performance this month convinced many that when Notre Dame was given a No. 3 seed and placed in the dreaded Kentucky quadrant, it was something the university’s famous football team almost never is: underrated.But in Pittsburgh last weekend, the Irish looked lethargic, eking out wins over Northeastern and Butler.AdvertisementCoach Mike Brey — whose mother died last Saturday, before Notre Dame’s overtime win over Butler — acknowledged as much, saying Wednesday, “I thought we played at such a high level in Greensboro; I don’t think we played that way in Pittsburgh, but we were mentally tough enough to find a way to do it.”Against Wichita State, Notre Dame displayed more mental toughness, proving it could take a punch and come back.On Saturday, the Irish (32-5) will face Kentucky in their first round-of-8 contest since 1979.“They’re hot and got a great system,” Wichita State Coach Gregg Marshall said after the game.The Irish have gone from Pittsburgh to Cleveland and, with another win, will head to Indianapolis, not too far from their campus in South Bend, Ind.“We keep saying, Getting closer and closer to home,” the sophomore guard Demetrius Jackson said.Despite its No. 7 seed, Wichita State was considered the favorite by many (including some oddsmakers). A veteran team, the Shockers had entered last year’s tournament undefeated before losing in the round of 32 to a Kentucky team that made the championship game.AdvertisementThe Irish (32-5) came out at Quicken Loans Arena looking like the team that played in Greensboro, hitting seven of their first eight from the field and jumping to an 18-5 lead. Constant movement created openings. Jerian Grant, a senior guard, found Zach Auguste cutting to the basket for a slam dunk. The sophomore Steve Vasturia, primarily an outside shooter, unleashed a wicked spin move on his way to the basket.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “They stretched the floor with guys that could shoot it,” the Shockers senior Fred VanVleet said after the game.On defense, Notre Dame also began in dominant fashion. The senior Pat Connaughton stole the ball from Shaquille Morris and on the next possession stuffed VanVleet.For the rest of the first half and into the second, the game slowed considerably, through a combination of strong defense and sloppy shooting, and Wichita State (30-5) crawled back. Although Notre Dame led, 33-30, at the half, the Shockers claimed a 38-37 lead early in the second half.Then Notre Dame regained a bit of its fire. Forward V. J. Beachem, working on the perimeter, got the ball in to Bonzie Colson, who pump-faked his defender and laid the ball in. Soon after, Vasturia and Connaughton connected on a neat give-and-go. With a little more than eight minutes left, Grant hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired, giving the Irish an 11-point lead. Despite a late 7-0 run from the Shockers, in which they pressed and double-teamed the ball, Notre Dame held on.Connaughton, who played nearly the whole game, contributed 16 points and 10 rebounds. But it was Jackson who shone as Notre Dame’s most effective player on offense, scoring 20.The Shockers, who were careful with the ball throughout the season, committed seven turnovers. They also had trouble shooting from outside, making just one of the nine 3-pointers in the second half.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But he was limited to three assists, a credit to the defensive effort by Jackson, Notre Dame’s point guard.Before the game, Grant had said he hoped that Jackson would serve as a dynamo.“I just wanted to do really well on both ends of the floor,” Jackson said of VanVleet. “Guard him hard, attack him on offense.”A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Notre Dame Again Relies on Its Mental Toughness.
