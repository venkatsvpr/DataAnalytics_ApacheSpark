A new report questions the idea that you can be “fat but fit.”Researchers studied the records of 1,317,713 Swedish men conscripted for mandatory military service from 1969 to 1996. All had their fitness tested objectively by cycling to exhaustion.Over the next 29 years, men in the highest one-fifth for fitness in adolescence had a 51 percent reduced risk of dying prematurely compared with those in the lowest fifth. But normal weight men, no matter what their level of fitness, were at 30 to 48 percent lower risk of premature death than obese men in the highest one-quarter for fitness. The study is in the International Journal of Epidemiology.The authors suggest that earlier studies that found that being aerobically fit can compensate for being overweight have evaluated older people or were of self-selected groups. Subjects of the present study had an average age of 18 and were representative of the overall male population.The senior author, Dr. Peter Nordstrom, a professor of geriatrics at Umea University, said that the data should be interpreted with care. “The results show that if you are fat and fit you still have a higher risk of death,” he said. “But given that these data are observational, one should be careful about drawing any conclusions. Is it a causal relationship, or are there other things involved?” A version of this article appears in print on 12/29/2015, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nutrition: Fitness Versus Fatness  .
