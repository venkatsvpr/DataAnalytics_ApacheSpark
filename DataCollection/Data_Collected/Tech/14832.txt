Also, someone who has downloaded it in those three countries would be able to find the creatures in Europe. Niantic’s first game, another augmented-reality app called Ingress, exists in Europe, and Pokémon Go uses information from that app to inform its digitally enhanced world.Brian Feldman, a journalist for New York magazine, which reported the Pokémon at Auschwitz, said that the person who sent in the tip was on vacation from America, and had been able to download the game from the U.S. app store.Niantic did not have anyone available who could respond to further requests for comment.A spokesman for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., said that the museum was also working to be excluded from the game.“Playing Pokémon Go in a memorial dedicated to the victims of Nazism is extremely inappropriate,” Andrew Hollinger said in a statement.“Technology can be an important learning tool, but this game falls far outside of our educational and memorial mission,” he added.Niantic has struggled to handle the sudden popularity of Pokémon Go, which was released in the United States on July 6. Its servers have had a hard time contending with the masses of people attempting to play, and the game’s official introduction in other countries has been delayed because of the unexpected demands.Pokémon have also provoked criticism by appearing at Arlington National Cemetery and on the front lines of the fight against ISIS in Iraq. The Marine Corps joked on Twitter that one had been spotted on a gun range, prompting some protest (and plenty of support).A military base in Washington State, in a Facebook post, warned “budding Pokémon Trainers” to avoid chasing the creatures “into controlled or restricted areas, office buildings, or homes on base.”Louis Park, the Marine Corps veteran who posted a picture of himself playing from Iraq, used another Facebook post to express his disappointment that it had taken “pop culture” to draw attention to the fight against ISIS. He has since made his account, including the original post, private.“I just made the picture post to be cheeky,” he wrote. “I love Pokémon.”Advertisement
