Trump and Twitter. The ousting of Ellen Pao, the interim chief executive of Reddit, the online message board, last year. And over the last week, the online outrage that followed the six-month sentence — many deemed it too lenient — of a Stanford University student who had been convicted of sexual assault.The New York Times’s technology reporters decided to take a closer look at the topic of digital cultures. Over the next few days, we will publish a series of stories on whether the web has helped spur more empathy, the state of online reviews, and digital games that have spilled into the physical world, among others, from writers including Farhad Manjoo, David Streitfeld and Vindu Goel.First up is Mark Scott’s profile of the small Spanish town Jun, which has decided to run all of its town communications on Twitter. In addition, we have Cecilia Kang’s interview with Mignon L. Clyburn, a Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission, on how millions are left out of online cultures entirely because of a lack of technology access.We hope you enjoy.Advertisement
