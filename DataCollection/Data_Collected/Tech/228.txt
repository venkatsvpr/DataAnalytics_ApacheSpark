AdvertisementSupported byBy Mark ScottAmerican and European officials working on a new agreement for the international transfer of digital data like social media posts and online search queries are at an impasse after two years of negotiations. And each side has the same excuse: It’s the other’s fault.On Tuesday, Europe’s top court struck down a 15-year-old agreement — known as safe harbor — that had allowed the flow of information across the Atlantic. The decision, by the European Court of Justice, raises major legal questions for companies like Facebook and Google about how they move the sort of data that powers their businesses.Officials have been trying to reach a new safe harbor deal since 2013, and the decision has intensified pressure on those negotiations. An agreement, officials and industry executives say, would most likely reduce much of the legal uncertainty arising from the court’s landmark ruling.Both sides stress that the remaining sticking points are surmountable, and that a new data agreement is imminent. But they will not offer any sort of timetable, and negotiators say that longstanding hurdles, including disagreements over national intelligence agencies’ access to people’s online data, continue to hold them back.From the perspective of American officials, the onus now lies with the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. The commission is charged with dealing with the consequences of the court’s privacy ruling.In contrast, European policy makers say the United States, which wants provisions in the new deal to allow American intelligence agencies access to European data for national security reasons, has stalled negotiations since the early summer.“Both the U.S. and Europe are equally to blame,” said Christopher Kuner, co-director of the Brussels Privacy Hub, a research center at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium. “It has been a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. Neither side realized that this ruling was coming or what impact it would have.”The protracted talks could have major implications on how companies — technology giants like Google and nontech companies like the drug maker Pfizer — handle people’s online data.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.At stake are social media posts from Facebook and Twitter, online search queries from Google and Bing, and digital book and movie purchases from Apple and Amazon. Many companies use this data to power sophisticated advertising operations that target individuals based on their web surfing habits. This digital advertising industry is expected to be worth more than $80 billion worldwide by 2018, according to the data provider eMarketer.By declaring that the current data-sharing arrangement does not provide sufficient privacy protections for European citizens, the region’s highest court has put these global dealings on shaky ground.“No matter what happens next, companies are looking at an extended period of uncertainty,” said Nigel Parker, a privacy lawyer at Allen & Overy in London.In public, senior policy makers from Europe and the United States have tried to show a united front.Vera Jourová, Europe’s justice commissioner, said on Tuesday that she would work with American officials in the Commerce Department, which is leading the negotiations, to complete a revamped data agreement. Penny Pritzker, the American secretary of commerce, also said she was willing to negotiate a new deal with European officials, in part to reduce uncertainty for companies like Google and Amazon.And negotiators have been in daily contact over the last month as both sides geared up for the European court’s decision, according to several people with direct knowledge of the discussions.The European justice commissioner is expected to continue negotiations with her American counterparts when she visits Washington in late November. Several senior American officials, including Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, have visited Europe in recent months to jump-start the stalled talks.American officials say they have fined companies a combined tens of millions of dollars in recent years for failing to protect people’s online information. Those figures are significantly higher than in Europe, where financial penalties are often capped. Several agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, also say Europe has failed to consider improvements to American privacy safeguards over the last two years that restrict what information is accessible to the country’s intelligence agencies.Yet for many European lawmakers, their citizens’ privacy — which is enshrined as a fundamental right on par with the freedom of expression — cannot be guaranteed until Europeans can bring legal cases in the United States when their data is misused. Any new safe harbor agreement is expected to give Europeans that right. Officials also want to limit the ability of American intelligence agencies to access European citizens’ data when it is transferred outside the European Union.“Everyone keeps saying they’re close to a deal,” said Emery Simon, counselor to the Software Alliance, a trade body in Washington. “But what we want to hear is that an agreement has been done.”Advertisement
