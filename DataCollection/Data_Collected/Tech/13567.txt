Founded in 2007, the company has over 1,000 employees and last year sold 21.3 million devices, almost twice the number of a year earlier.Sound good? It might be, but for the aura accorded to Apple products. For many tech product reviewers and fans, Apple’s Watch, wrist-worn and capable of doing what Fitbit does, it the standard by which Fitbit falls short.The Apple Watch does more things. The Apple Watch is an Apple product, and those sell well. Fitbit announces a new product and its stock drops, because it is not Apple.Never mind that Fitbits sell for much less, probably to a different audience, or that Apple’s last quarter showed declining sales. While Apple is quick to trumpet its sales triumphs, after a full year it still hasn’t given numbers on Watch sales. (Estimates are that it sold 12 million, but with unknown profitability, partly because of the huge marketing put behind Apple Watch.)The real problem the company seems to be struggling with is that it is not Apple, which basks in an aura of cool design excellence and unbeatable success.Fitbit is a single-purpose device, unlike the multipurpose iPhone or Watch, but that’s been true for years, and Fitbit keeps increasing sales. It may be that there is room in the world for both things.On the other hand, that may be too rational a view for the tech world and its investors.Advertisement
