The director Oliver Stone has even mused that the augmented reality game is a troubling sign that as a society we are sliding into techno-totalitarianism. Or something like that. Mr. Stone was promoting an upcoming movie about techno-totalitarianism, so the connection probably made sense when he said it.On Wednesday night, a crowd estimated to be in the hundreds (though not the thousands some had expected) gathered in San Francisco for a group Pokémon hunt. It was, as David Streitfeld writes, a bit of harmless fun — a tent pole amusement for a society that could use some lighter moments.That is, assuming no one wandered into traffic, fell off a cliff, failed to notice a mugger behind them, or any of the other mishaps that have befallen Pokémon gamers.Advertisement
