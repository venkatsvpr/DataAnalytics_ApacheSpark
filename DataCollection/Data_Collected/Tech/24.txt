According to the agreement, Unisplendour must hold onto the shares for five years and will have limited voting rights.The investment is Unisplendour’s second multibillion-dollar deal this year, and it underscores how state-controlled Chinese companies have made increasingly large investments in American technology companies in the hopes of gaining prestige and expertise.The deal also presents a new test to American regulators charged with overseeing investments in industries that could have national security implications.Over the last two years, Tsinghua Holdings, the parent company of Unisplendour, has used huge investments and acquisitions to emerge as a leader in China’s effort to expand its technological capabilities in semiconductors and computer memory. The company is controlled by the Chinese government, and the son of Hu Jintao, the former Chinese president, was once its party secretary, a position responsible for communicating and cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party.In May, Unisplendour paid $2.3 billion for a 51 percent stake in Hewlett-Packard’s Chinese server unit, H3C Technologies. Tsinghua Holdings also made an informal bid of $23 billion for the American memory chip maker Micron Technology in July through another subsidiary, called Tsinghua Unigroup.With technology increasingly becoming a crucial point of friction between the United States and China, the investment in Western Digital could attract attention from American regulators. As one of the United States’ largest makers of hard drives, which are used in data centers across the country that support American banks, social media sites and even the military, Western Digital could be considered a problematic takeover target.A report released this year by Kaspersky, a security company, suggested how critical Western Digital’s technology can be. According to the report, an unidentified hacking group was able to download spyware to carry out surveillance on computers across the globe through firmware in storage systems from a number of companies, including Western Digital.The concerns around data storage could prompt a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews company acquisitions and investments that could pose threats to American security. After the bid for Micron by Tsinghua, several American politicians said the proposed deal should be blocked. Though Unisplendour’s investment is only a minority one, it would make the company one of the largest shareholders in Western Digital.The new relationship may also help Western Digital with a longstanding issue it has had with China’s Ministry of Commerce, which has held up approval of Western Digital’s 2012 acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technology. According to the Ministry of Commerce ruling, Western Digital was required to run Hitachi as a separate business until it gained approval for the acquisition. Western Digital has twice been fined by the Chinese government for defying the regulator’s orders.During Western Digital’s third fiscal quarter earnings call this year, its chief executive, Steve Milligan, said that the delay by the Ministry of Commerce was affecting the company’s ability to “respond to changing market dynamics.”“Lifting the hold-separate restriction would be beneficial to consumers and our customers by promoting innovation and enhancing the competitive environment,” he added.Over the last year, other companies facing regulatory scrutiny from China, like Microsoft and Qualcomm, have announced new deals that analysts say served an alternate function of ingratiating them with the Chinese government.Western Digital’s shares rose about 14 percent on the Nasdaq in afternoon trading after the announcement of the deal.Advertisement
