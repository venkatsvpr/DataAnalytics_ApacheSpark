It has become common wisdom among tech start-ups that an initial public offering of shares is something that should occur only after all other options have been exhausted.The start-ups have reasons for this — they don’t want to suffer the quarterly prodding of profit-hungry Wall Street investors, for example. But more often than not, it’s because they don’t want to deal with the financial scrutiny required of a publicly traded company.This can be a problem for employees of those start-ups who are often compensated in company shares that can be worth a lot of money if the company goes public.As Katie Benner writes, now some companies are giving employees “controlled opportunities” to sell shares. Last month, Airbnb gave its employees an opportunity to sell some of their stock to investors. In return, the employees had to agree not to sell or trade the rest of their shares.Reaching deals like this are important to young companies like Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco. Frustrated employees are apt to leave if they believe a promised payday in the form of a stock sale isn’t going to happen. And in an area where employee retention has become a major issue, it’s all too easy for workers to defect to the next, hot start-up.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
