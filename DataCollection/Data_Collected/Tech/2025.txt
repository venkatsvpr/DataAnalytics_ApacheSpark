Over the last six months, United Nations diplomats have negotiated over the text of a document set to define the policies and frameworks of how the Internet is governed in the future, and who has a role in the process.The final version presented on Wednesday before the General Assembly contains a word that civil society groups, businesses and many Western governments oppose: multilateral.Multilateral is code for states making the rules. The inclusion of the word was largely spearheaded by China, which worked to enshrine state control over the Internet in the document, said negotiators who were involved in the process. During the discussions, representatives from China demanded repeatedly that the word be included, according to participants and draft versions of the document that laid out which countries made each submission.“China has been very active in the negotiations at pushing for more state control over how people get online and who has access to data,” said Peter Micek, global policy and legal counsel for Access Now, a digital-rights organization based in New York that was involved in the negotiation efforts.AdvertisementThe outcome document, presented at a United Nations meeting known as the Ten-Year Review of the World Summit on the Information Society, is an indication of how China is trying to assert its influence over how the Internet will be governed. Although the document is nonbinding for member states, it outlines policies and grants authority to United Nations bodies like the International Telecommunication Union and others in which China exerts significant influence. The document also provides an international precedent that governments can claim legitimizes their own agendas.AdvertisementChina failed to get many of its proposed insertions and deletions of language into the text. At points, Chinese officials tried to remove phrases like “freedom of expression” and “democratic,” which other nations wanted to include to safeguard human rights and privacy online. The final version of the document still has those phrases.The final document almost completely rejects the multilateral model, which is mentioned once. Instead it repeatedly endorses the more inclusive “multistakeholder” approach to Internet governance proposed by the United States, the European Union and developing nations like Brazil and India. This model promotes a management system based on the consensus of civil society, businesses, academic institutions, engineers and governments.President Xi Jinping of China called for transforming the global Internet governance system and ensuring a multilateral approach to Internet policy.“To their credit, negotiators fought off the worst proposals, and recognized that our human rights to privacy and expression, and access to information and digital security tools, remain under threat,” Mr. Micek said.Still, China appears satisfied that the document recognized “a leading role” for governments in cybersecurity matters relating to national security — one of China’s top objectives — and that it refers to the United Nations Charter, which enshrines principles of state sovereignty and nonintervention by the United Nations in domestic affairs.“We think those principles apply to Internet communication technologies,” said one of the Chinese negotiators, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “We found that the outcome document is in China’s interest.”The document was formally adopted as China holds its World Internet Conference, which started Wednesday. The conference is part of a global lobbying effort by China aimed at promoting a concept, “Internet sovereignty,” which maintains that each nation should have the unfettered right to regulate cyberinfrastructure and activities in its territory, including the ability to censor and restrict information within and across its borders.The three-day meeting, held in the eastern province of Zhejiang, was used last year by officials to urge participants to sign a pledge accepting China’s claims to Internet sovereignty. Concerns that a new document could be circulated have led to less Western corporate and diplomatic participation this year, according to several people familiar with the attendees, who asked not to be named to avoid retaliation by Chinese authorities.AdvertisementChina has long tried to gain a broader say in how the Internet and technology more generally are regulated worldwide. Beijing has prevailed on state-run telecom operators to spend heavily to gain more influence in cellular standards, while Chinese officials have worked their way up the hierarchies in global regulatory bodies, like the International Telecommunication Union, whose secretary general is Chinese. The agency has increasingly taken on cybersecurity management, a prime Chinese objective, as a result of the first World Summit on the Information Society outcome document, adopted in 2005.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, endorsed Internet sovereignty in his keynote address at the Chinese Internet conference on Wednesday. Lu Wei, China’s Internet czar, whose handle on the popular social messaging app WeChat translates to “I’m Watching You,” has raised his international profile with trips abroad to lobby for acceptance of China’s view of how the Internet should be managed. That includes a major Chinese-American technology forum held in Seattle in September with top executives from Silicon Valley companies like Apple and Facebook.In China’s view, Internet sovereignty justifies the tangle of controls used to monitor its more than 640 million Internet users and restrict what they see and say online with a system known as the Great Firewall that blocks thousands of foreign websites.The first World Summit on the Information Society produced a document that set agendas and processes largely focused on issues like bridging the digital divide between developed and developing nations. But the rise of social media and hacking over the last decade spurred some countries, including China, to demand last year a renegotiation of previous Internet governance agreements that excluded all nongovernment stakeholders.Even after that was rejected, negotiations over the current outcome document, which began this summer and involved all United Nations member states, quickly turned into a furious battle over language about security and the rights of governments to control the Internet within their digital borders, participants said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Western bloc negotiated for two days before the other side withdrew the proposal, participants said.While Internet sovereignty does not appear in the final document, many diplomats and civil society groups say they remain wary of China’s “multilateral” intentions.“The Chinese are terrific negotiators,” said David A. Gross, a former State Department coordinator for international communications and information policy. Mr. Gross led the American delegation to the first World Summit on the Information Society and is representing the Internet Governance Coalition, an American telecommunications and media industry group, at this year’s General Assembly meeting.“They set things up over time in order to advance their interests and they don’t feel the need to win everything off the bat,” he said.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.A version of this article appears in print on December 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Role for State in Internet Policy Shows China’s Influence at U.N.
