It is  unclear whether the F.B.I. got much of use out of the phone.In the Brooklyn case, prosecutors want to open an iPhone 5s owned by Jun Feng, 45, a methamphetamine dealer who claimed to have forgotten his passcode. Mr. Feng has pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the case, but prosecutors say his phone could hold information leading to other suspects.In a stinging rebuke five weeks ago, however, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein said in a 50-page ruling that the Justice Department had overstepped its authority in trying to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to compel Apple’s cooperation.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Apple had previously agreed without objection to help unlock dozens of phones in federal investigations, but it changed its position late last year, saying that the F.B.I.’s demands could cause “reputational harm” as it promotes the security of its devices.An Apple lawyer said the company was disappointed but not surprised by the government’s decision to press ahead in Brooklyn.The lawyer, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity because of company policy, argued that prosecutors were pushing the case not because of the value of the information in the phone, but rather to set a precedent that could be used to get into other locked iPhones.A ruling in the government’s favor in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn would not be binding in other cases, but if it were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and upheld there, it would become precedent for other federal courts in the region.Justice Department lawyers point to Apple’s past cooperation in arguing that it should be compelled to unlock Mr. Feng’s phone. But Joseph DeMarco, a former prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said that alone would not be enough to overturn Judge Orenstein’s order.“Apple can still argue that it doesn’t have to comply with this order,” he said. “The fact that it has done so before is relevant but not, as a technical matter, legally binding.”The method used by the F.B.I. to get into the San Bernardino phone has been a topic of furious speculation at Apple and among encryption experts.The Apple lawyer said on Friday that the company had decided not to sue the F.B.I. to find out how it got into the phone, in part because Apple’s regular product updates would probably give the method a short shelf life.The company works constantly to find and fix vulnerabilities, and its lawyers said they were confident that it would render useless the tool used by the F.B.I. in the San Bernardino case, even if it never knew for sure the method involved.The company’s lawyers plan to argue that the San Bernardino phone used a new operating system and was much harder to break into than the phone in the Brooklyn case would be. With a higher bar set, the company will question why the government cannot turn to the same marketplace of technicians that helped it crack the San Bernardino phone.Apple executives, including Timothy D. Cook, the chief, argue that Congress, not the courts, should set broad policies on investigators’ access to encrypted data.A bill being drafted by the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee — Richard M. Burr, a North Carolina Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat — would compel companies to provide “technical assistance” to law enforcement officials in such cases, according to the newspaper The Hill.But many officials in Washington doubt that a divided Congress will be able to reach agreement on such a complicated issue, and the draft bill drew quick protests even before its release, with the American Civil Liberties Union calling it “a clear threat to everyone’s privacy and security.”Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from New York.Advertisement
