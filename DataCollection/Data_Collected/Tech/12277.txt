Lawmakers at the hearing lobbed questions at two of the main figures in the debate: James B. Comey Jr., the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Bruce Sewell, Apple’s general counsel.And as Cecilia Kang and Eric Lichtblau reported, many lawmakers seemed torn over where to draw the line on privacy.“The big question for our country is how much privacy are we going to give up in the name of security,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Mr. Comey, “and there’s no easy answer to that.”Across the country, in San Francisco, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and other administration officials visited the RSA Conference, arguably the world’s largest gathering of computer security experts. In a speech at the event, Nicole Perlroth reported, Ms. Lynch emphasized the need to find common ground.Later in an interview on stage, Ms. Lynch said that the middle ground is to do “what the law requires.” The crowd responded with a smattering of laughter and hisses — suggesting, once again, that while the debate is widespread, it is far from settled.Advertisement
