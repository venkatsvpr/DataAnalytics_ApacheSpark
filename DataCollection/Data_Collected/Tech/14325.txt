Wall Street bought the story that LinkedIn was a Facebook for professionals and its shares traded at 50 times earnings at their peak.But while the company, based in Mountain View, Calif., has grown tremendously, Monday’s announcement that it will be acquired by Microsoft makes clear that LinkedIn was not destined to be as big as Facebook as an independent entity. Here is a look at LinkedIn’s biggest moments:2003 In 2002, Reid Hoffman, formerly chief operating officer of PayPal, had formed a small team with colleagues to work on what would become LinkedIn. The site was introduced in 2003.2004 and 2005 LinkedIn reached roughly one million members and began introducing products to generate revenue. Among these were a job search function and tools for recruiters; the latter would become one of the company’s most successful business lines.2008 and 2009 LinkedIn opened an office in Britain and introduced versions of its site in different languages. After nearly two years as chief executive, Dan Nye stepped down in January 2009; Mr. Hoffman returned as C.E.O. and was then succeeded by Jeff Weiner, who remains in the position to this day. Mr. Hoffman is executive chairman.2011 LinkedIn debuted on the New York Exchange. Shares soared to more than double the initial offering price of $45.2012 LinkedIn disclosed it was infiltrated by hackers. While initially the company said only about six million passwords were stolen, LinkedIn acknowledged in May 2016 that the number was more than 100 million passwords.February 2016 After years of strong performance, LinkedIn shares plunged by 44 percent after a weaker-than-expected earnings report. The drop wiped out nearly $11 billion in market value in a single trading day.June 2016 LinkedIn agreed to be acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion. Shares of LinkedIn surged more than 46 percent on the news.Advertisement
