HONG KONG —  When a draft of China’s new national security law was made public in May, critics argued that it was too broad and left much open to interpretation.In the final form of the law, which the government said Wednesday had been enacted, Beijing got more specific, but in a way that is sending ripples through the global technology industry.New language in the rules calls for a “national security review” of the technology industry — including networking and other products and services — and foreign investment. The law also calls for technology that supports crucial sectors to be “secure and controllable,” a catchphrase that multinationals and industry groups say could be used to force companies to build so-called back doors — which allow third-party access to systems — provide encryption keys or even hand over source code.As with many Chinese laws, the language is vague enough to make it unclear how the law will be enforced, but it suggests a new front in the wider clash between China and the United States over online security and technology policy.AdvertisementThe United States has accused China of state-sponsored hacking attacks against American companies to gain a commercial advantage, and of creating policies meant to force the transfer of intellectual property to Chinese companies.AdvertisementIn turn, China maintains that the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former United States National Security Agency contractor, about American online espionage give it plenty of reason to wean itself from foreign technology that may have been tampered with by United States intelligence agencies.The most recent policy clash between the United States and China came in April, and it ended with Beijing’s saying that it would withdraw a law that restricted which technology products could be sold by foreign companies to Chinese banks. Groups that represent companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft had pushed against that law.At the time, the withdrawal was billed as a victory for foreign companies, but the recent additions to the Chinese national security law show that it might have been a brief reprieve. The changes to the law are also likely to increase lobbying pressure on the United States by multinationals aimed at a separate Chinese measure, a counterterrorism law that Beijing is expected to pass this year and that could include stronger restrictions on foreign technologies being sold into China.“I think it’s a perfect storm: The cybersecurity concerns because of Snowden and the techno-nationalist perspective have really gained strength over the past few years,” said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “China is not particularly swayed by or sympathetic to arguments that the foreign companies have made, and they’re going to push forward on all these fronts.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, for instance, oversees and occasionally bars investment in sensitive industries by countries like China.AdvertisementStill, foreign companies argue that Beijing is likely to use such an oversight body to favor local companies and to push multinationals to do more to help Chinese companies develop more advanced capabilities.Mr. Segal pointed to one phrase in the new Chinese law that could be particularly problematic: “secure and controllable.”“Since no one knows how you implement that phrase,” he said, “foreign companies are worried about what that’s going to mean. Does it mean they have to give access through back doors, or are they going to have to partner with Chinese firms?”Mr. Segal added that one recourse would be to argue through the World Trade Organization that what China considers national security concerns are not valid.A version of this article appears in print on July 3, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: China’s New National Security Law Dismays Tech Sector, Which Fears Intrusion .
