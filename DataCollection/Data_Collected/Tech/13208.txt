You should not notice any difference if you use your Verizon Wireless cellular or data services or go into a Verizon store, though you might spot pickets outside some Verizon Wireless stores.Most of the workers who went on strike were employed in the company’s wireline business, though a small group of Verizon Wireless employees were among the strikers.But — and this is a big but — if the strike goes on for a while, Verizon wireline customers could see a gradual deterioration of customer service quality. The company says it has trained plenty of people to fill in for union employees who walked off the job, but you can’t expect them to be able to provide the same quality as people who have been doing it for years. And the company has only trained 10,000 or so people to do the work of the 36,000 union members.Unfortunately, don’t expect any discounts in your next phone bill if that customers service isn’t up to snuff.Advertisement
