The support will appear like a united front against the government, which is trying to get Apple to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the terrorist attack last year in San Bernardino, Calif.As Nick Wingfield and Mike Isaac report, the support, in many cases, took a little time in coming and involved some hand-wringing. Still, the final decision to support Apple, they write, shows that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.That could be part of the reason that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter sought some middle ground in the debate on Wednesday. In a speech at a digital security conference in San Francisco, he said he was not in favor of a “back door” that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.Of course, the software Apple is being asked to create is considered by some to be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible because of passwords or encryption. Still, the tone coming from some government officials seems to be changing somewhat. Maybe that united front is already working.Advertisement
