NASA’s Messenger spacecraft crashed into Mercury on Thursday.
Mapping a planet Messenger spent four years orbiting, mapping and studying the planet Mercury. The spinnable globe above is a composite of thousands of photographs. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and about 40 percent wider than the moon.NorthPoleMessenger’sfirst orbit inMarch 2011Enters Mercury orbit in 2011Final orbit onThursdayMERCURYThird Mercury flyby in 2009Two Mercury flybys in 2008SunMarch2013Two Venus flybysin 2006 and ’07March2012Launched in 2004,Earth flyby in 2005NorthPoleMessenger’sfirst orbit inMarch 2011Final orbit onThursdayEnters Mercury orbit in 2011MERCURYThird Mercury flyby in 2009Two Mercury flybys in 2008SunMarch2013Two Venusflybys in2006–07Launched in 2004,Earth flyby in 2005March2012Messenger enters Mercury orbit in 2011Three Mercuryflybys in 2008–09SunTwo Venusflybys in2006–07Launched in 2004,Earth flyby in 2005NorthPoleMessenger’sfirst orbit inMarch 2011Final orbit onThursdayMERCURYMarch2013March2012Messenger’sfirst orbit inMarch 2011NorthPoleFinal orbit onThursdayEnters Mercury orbit in 2011MERCURYThree Mercuryflybys in 2008–09SunMarch2013Two Venusflybys in2006–07Launched in 2004,Earth flyby in 2005March2012A contracting spiral Messenger spiraled through the inner solar system for nearly seven years before arriving at Mercury in March 2011. The spacecraft ran out of fuel on April 24 and crashed into Mercury’s northern hemisphere on April 30, at a speed of 2.4 miles per second.Liftoff Messenger was launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The name Messenger is an acronym for “Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging.”Passing Earth A year after launching, Messenger completed its first planetary flyby and looked back as it passed Earth.Six flybys Messenger performed a record-setting six planetary flybys, using the gravity of three planets to slow its speed and adjust its direction. Messenger flew by Earth once, Venus twice and Mercury three times.Entering Mercury orbit Messenger went into orbit around Mercury on March 29, 2011, and was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.Polar ice in shadow Messenger confirmed that some craters near Mercury’s poles contain water ice, protected from the sun’s heat in pockets of permanent shadow.Hollows and vents Messenger has found flat depressions, top row, in many of Mercury’s craters. These “hollows” often have pale edges and may have formed where volatile materials were lost to space. Messenger has also discovered and photographed many volcanic vents, bottom row.Past contractions Messenger found evidence that Mercury’s iron core gradually shrank as it cooled over billions of years, cracking and buckling the planet’s surface.Lava flows Much of Mercury’s northern hemisphere is covered with smooth plains that were once flooded with lava.Crater rays and chains Pale rays extend hundreds of miles from many of Mercury’s craters, top row. Rays are caused by subsurface material ejected during impact and tend to fade over time. Material flung out of an impact crater can also make chains of small craters extending in a long line, bottom row.Final maneuvers, and one last image Messenger performed its final course correction on April 24, 2015, using the last of its fuel to delay its crash slightly. The spacecraft continued to send back pictures during its last orbit, but crashed with over 1,000 images in its memory that will never make it back to Earth.Today Messenger gouged a new crater in Mercury’s surface, though it will probably take a future spacecraft to find it.Sources and images: NASA; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; Carnegie Institution of WashingtonAdditional production by Shan Carter.Advertisement
