Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick and an author of the new study, which appears in the journal Science.Stone tools found at the site resemble those found in northern France, another clue that there may have been trade between the two groups.AdvertisementThe researchers analyzed sediment cores from Bouldnor Cliff, on the coast of the Isle of Wight, and found ancient DNA from certain wheat strains. There was no evidence of cultivation, however, suggesting that the hunter-gatherers obtained the wheat as flour.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
