Pagan civilizations on Earth, including the ancient culture that built Stonehenge, were aware of it. They developed festivals to celebrate it leading up to the Roman Saturnalia that took place Dec. 17-23. In the 4th century A.D., the Christian church appropriated the festival, overlaying it with the celebration of the birth of Christ. Second, according to the web site Phys.org, the so-called Star of Bethlehem may have been a visible conjunction in the eastern sky of several planets, leading to a calculation of a possible birth date for Jesus of April 17 in 6 B.C. This evidence becomes the basis for support of the theory of the birth date being moved to Dec. 25, thus overlaying the Romans who, according to the church, were obviously having way too much fun during the six days of Saturnalia. None of these phenomena, nor cultural responses to them, are likely accessible to aliens on other planets. This is not to deny them their own belief systems, nor even that a universal God might manifest differently to earthlings and their alien counterparts.We just need to be careful about projecting our most heartfelt beliefs onto their potential existence.Dan YurmanMacedonia, OhioAdvertisement
