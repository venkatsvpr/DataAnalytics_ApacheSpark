(Stanford University last year pledged to drop coal stocks from its $21.4 billion endowment.)The university’s chancellor, Kent Syverud, said the move was part of Syracuse’s “long record of supporting responsible environmental stewardship and good corporate citizenship.”Student protesters staged an 18-day sit-in in November over divestment and other issues. Katie McChesney, a campus divestment campaign organizer with the climate action group 350.org, said the student action showed that “if you want results, turn up the heat.”Advertisement
