The reasons for the suspension were not immediately clear. A person familiar with the program, called Free Basics, which provides free access to text-only versions of Facebook and other services, said the Egyptian government had ordered it closed down. Reuters quoted an Egyptian telecommunications official as saying that Etisalat, the cellphone company that carried the services, had been granted a two-month permit for Free Basics that had expired on Wednesday.The suspension comes as the government of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has intensified its efforts to thwart any possible protests on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of the Arab Spring uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Social media had played a critical role in the 2011 revolt, including Facebook, which organizers used to mobilize the massive demonstrations that ultimately led to the fall of Mr. Mubarak.The government banned any unauthorized protests more than two years ago. In recent days, the authorities have arrested young anti-government dissidents affiliated with the anti-Mubarak uprising, and raided cultural organizations that were gathering places for young activists.In a statement, Facebook said the company was “disappointed that Free Basics will no longer be available in Egypt,” and said it hoped “to resolve this situation soon.”The program, which started in Egypt in October, was part of Facebook’s ambitious and disputed plan to bring Internet service to billions of people in developing countries. In its statement, Facebook said that of the more than three million Egyptians who had signed up, more than one million “were previously unconnected” to the Internet.Free Basics has drawn criticism, including for providing a limited service with selected partners rather than unrestricted Internet access, and for violating net neutrality, which calls for all Internet services to be treated equally by telecommunications carriers.Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has mounted an aggressive campaign to defend Free Basics, including running full-page newspaper ads and writing an opinion piece published in The Times of India on Monday that asked, “Who could possibly be against this?”The program, which operates in more than two dozen countries, offers cellphone users free access to a limited set of Internet services including Facebook’s social network and messaging services, news, health and job information.Facebook argues that the program introduces the poor to the Internet and that many become paying customers for broader access to the Internet. Last week, regulators in India ordered the suspension of the program after Reliance Communications, Facebook’s partner there, failed to provide information on the service before a planned expansion.
