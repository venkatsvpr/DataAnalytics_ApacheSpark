Gregory Gause III, a professor of international relations at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A & M University.At the same time, the king retained the ministers in charge of oil, Ali al-Naimi; the interior, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef; and foreign affairs, Prince Saud al-Faisal; as well as finance and labor, implying continuity in some of the kingdom’s most high-profile portfolios, Professor Gause said.Many of the changes had to do with the abolition of government bodies, including oversight councils for education, oil and other issues. The king also disbanded the National Security Council and dismissed its chief, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, who was an ambassador to the United States and the country’s intelligence chief before drifting from the center of power in recent years.To replace them, the king created two new councils focusing on security and economics.He also named the interior minister, Prince Mohammed, the head of the Council of Political and Security Affairs. That position further enhances the power of the prince, who was recently named second in line to succeed the king and is respected in Riyadh and Washington for fighting Islamic militancy.King Salman also named one of his sons, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as president of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs.Speaking privately, diplomats and Saudi analysts have puzzled over the amount of power the king has given to Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is, in his mid-30s, decades younger than most of the country’s leaders.His father named him not only defense minister but also head of the royal court, which allows him to control access to the king.Salman also replaced the head of intelligence and fired two sons of the late King Abdullah from their jobs as the governors of the provinces of Mecca and Riyadh. Both had been appointed by their father. Another of Abdullah’s sons, however, kept his post as minister for the National Guard.The bonuses Salman ordered imply that he was not worried about how his government would adjust to the drop in government revenues because of the sharp fall in oil prices.“At a time when you think it’d be, ‘We have to tighten our belts some,’ it is ‘Here is a big present,’ ” Professor Gause said.Advertisement
