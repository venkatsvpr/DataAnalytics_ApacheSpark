The claim was the latest of several that the isolated country has made about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Kim had made the assertion during a visit to the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site, which honors the works of his father and grandfather, who ruled North Korea before him.His forebears’ work turned North Korea into “a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying.The White House on Thursday said it was doubtful that North Korea had developed a hydrogen bomb.”At this point, the information that we have access to calls into serious question those claims, but we take very seriously the risk and the threat that is posed by the North Korean regime in their ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters, according to Reuters.Although the report was the first time Mr. Kim had claimed that the North had developed a hydrogen bomb, several years ago a state-run newspaper asserted that the North may have been trying to build one. In May 2010, the front page of Rodong Sinmun, North Korea’s top state-run newspaper, declared that its scientists had succeeded in creating a nuclear fusion reaction, a crucial technology for creating a hydrogen bomb.At the time, many observers ridiculed the claim by North Korea, which often uses bombastic assertions to increase leverage over its enemies in negotiations or to burnish its image at home. But the claim was never completely dismissed.A photographer parts the curtains on one of the world’s least-known places and brings back pictures of a country that is defined for many by mystery and war.Hwang Jang-yop, a former secretary of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party who defected to Seoul in 1997, said the North had long researched nuclear fusion while trying to build a hydrogen bomb, as well as atomic weapons. Mr. Hwang died in October 2010.North Korea conducted underground tests to set off nuclear devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013. It has since claimed to have developed “diversified” and “miniaturized” nuclear devices, but Western experts remain unsure.On Thursday, South Korean officials said that there was no evidence that the North had hydrogen bomb capacity. But they also noted that North Korea has repeatedly vowed to improve its nuclear arsenal, which is believed to include several weapons, though none as destructive as a hydrogen bomb.In a paper published in May, Lee Chun-keun, a senior researcher at the Science and Technology Policy Institute of South Korea, said North Korea acquired laser nuclear fusion equipment from China in the 1980s and that it might be developing a reinforced nuclear weapon from nuclear fusion.“Tests of such an advanced atomic weapon can be done in a lab without an actual nuclear explosion,” he wrote. “Further development of nuclear fusion technology would lead to the development of reinforced atomic arms and furthermore hydrogen bomb developments as well.”Making a true hydrogen bomb is very difficult. But weapon designers can easily boost the destructive power of an atom bomb by putting at its core a small amount of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen.In a paper published by the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington in September, David Albright and Serena Kelleher-Vergantini said that North Korea might be trying to use the only operational reactor at its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, to produce tritium.“Tritium would enable nuclear weapons designs that could have a greater explosive yield than weapons made from only plutonium or weapon-grade uranium,” they wrote. “Whether North Korea can make nuclear weapons using tritium is unknown although we believe that it remains a technical problem North Korea still needs to solve.”Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
