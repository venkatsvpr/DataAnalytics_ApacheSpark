The Taliban’s takeover of the northern Afghan city of Kunduz gives the insurgency control over a crucial corridor, and potential to further its reach.KABUL, Afghanistan —  Afghan government forces on Thursday rallied for the first time to try to retake the city of Kunduz from Taliban fighters, engaging in heavy fighting near the city center, residents and government officials said.After nightfall, however, witnesses said the battle for the city was still undecided. People caught in the city described cowering in their homes as shrapnel flew, and the occasional mortar shell or rocket crashed down.Despite the long-awaited response by government forces in Kunduz, it was not enough to reassure civilians in neighboring provinces, as the outlines of a Taliban offensive across northern Afghanistan became clearer.Some in the nearby provincial capitals — Pul-i-Kumri, in Baghlan Province south of Kunduz, and Taliqan in Takhar Province, to the east — said they were preparing to leave rather than risk being trapped in a Taliban assault.In Takhar, people were further unnerved by reports that a northern district of the province had fallen to the Taliban on Thursday morning.Advertisement“People are in a state of fear here,” said Ahmad Khalid, a resident of Kunduz who had fled to Taliqan on Thursday. He said that as he walked around the city, he kept seeing other Kunduz residents who had sought refuge. But Takhar residents were talking about getting out. “The people in Takhar are also preparing to leave. They fear this city will fall more easily than Kunduz.”AdvertisementIn Baghlan Province, the southeastern district of Tala Wa Barfak fell to the Taliban on Thursday. The district, while sparsely populated, borders the majority Hazara province of Bamian and has one of the few east-west roads running through it. Many Taliban in the past have viewed Hazaras as apostates.The prospect of a domino effect in the country’s northeast with villages, districts and potentially another provincial capital falling under Taliban control was worrying Western military strategists as well. They believe that the longer the Taliban can stave off a decisive counteroffensive by the government, the more momentum the insurgents will gain.In Washington, senior Pentagon and other government officials confirmed on Thursday that Kunduz had not yet been fully reclaimed from the Taliban, and expressed frustration and bewilderment at what they said was a slow, disjointed effort to carry out an effective counterattack.
                At least one-fifth of the country is controlled or contested by the Taliban.            “The military leadership here is really frustrated with the Afghan leadership,” said one senior United States official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence and operations assessments. “They have not been able to maintain momentum.”The American official acknowledged the similarities with the sudden Islamic State offensive in northern and western Iraq last year, when the Iraqi security forces in Mosul and other spots melted away despite vastly outnumbering the attackers. “If the Afghans don’t check things really fast, it has the potential to be like Mosul,” the official said.So far, however, American officials have ruled out sending any large number of troops to help Afghans in the north. The American official said that discussions were underway to possibly send another dozen or so Special Operations forces to advise the Afghan security forces on the effort to retake Kunduz, and prevent the loss of any other northern cities, the official said.The Taliban interest in Kunduz and Takhar has its roots not only in the movement’s decades-long presence in the region, but also in economics.AdvertisementThe roads through both provinces lead across the Amu Darya river to Tajikistan, making them some of the country’s most lucrative drug routes. They are used by traffickers moving opium from the poppy prolific provinces in the south to Tajikistan and on to Kyrgyzstan from which the opium or heroin finds its way across Central Asia and to Russia and Europe. Whoever controls the roads gets to take a cut, and the Taliban have long financed themselves in part through poppy production.A second benefit is the rich agricultural land in Kunduz and Takhar, which if they controlled the province they could use both as a source of income by taxing harvests and to sustain themselves if they were unable to obtain goods from other parts of the country.“Last year in February and March we decided that the military struggle in the south had made no significant gains,” said Commander Hajji Qadir, a Taliban commander in a district of Badakhshan Province, Waduj, that fell to the insurgents on Thursday. “Therefore military offensives should begin in the northern region, particularly the four northeastern provinces,” he said, adding that they appeared “strategic and valuable.”Even if the Taliban are forced to withdraw from the city of Kunduz, this recent show of strength will only make it that much easier for them to levy a share of the local commerce — be that wheat or drug trafficking.By day’s end it was hard to say that either the government or the Taliban controlled Kunduz, but the government appeared to be making headway. Unless reinforcements arrived, it was not clear whether they could hold the ground through the night.To the south, a large group of Afghan soldiers who had set out days ago to help reinforce Kunduz remained mostly stuck in northern Baghlan Province, advancing painstakingly slowly as they were frequently halted by Taliban ambushes and roadblocks, officials said.A reporter in Baghlan said the military convoy, with more than 1,000 soldiers, was moving several truck lengths at a time between halts.“The Taliban blocked the Baghlan-Kunduz highway by placing sandbags on the road in several places; some of the forces crossed the roadblocks,” the reporter said. “The reinforcements move very slowly — they send five or 10 trucks ahead and then stop when they come under fire.”AdvertisementIn Kunduz, the Taliban were deploying a variety of tactics, including using the homes of locals to hide and wearing Afghan security force uniforms to confuse their enemies. Although there were scattered reports of some Taliban leaving the city, it appeared that many were still there.Hundreds of civilians and members of the government forces had been holed up in the airport south of Kunduz since Monday, and reinforcements sent from other provinces have been delayed or halted by Taliban resistance in outlying areas.Residents reached in parts of Kunduz Province beyond the city said that the Taliban remained in control in the district of Chardara. That district is one of the most strategically important in the province because of a road to the largest city in Afghanistan’s north, Mazar-i-Sharif, runs through it.Reporting was contributed by Ahmad Shakib and Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul, an employee of The New York Times from Baghlan, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.A version of this article appears in print on October 2, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Afghan Forces Rally in Kunduz, but Fight Is Far From Decided .
