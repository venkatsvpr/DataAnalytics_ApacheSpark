HONG KONG — The first state visit by President Xi Jinping of China to the United States will take place in September, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.The report came after Mr. Xi and President Obama spoke by telephone on Wednesday morning, which was Tuesday in Washington. They discussed a wide range of issues, including climate change, Iran’s nuclear program and China’s currency policy, according to a White House statement. Neither the statement nor the Xinhua report offered further specifics about the conversation.In addition to visiting the White House, Mr. Xi will attend events in New York commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, Xinhua reported.The timing of the visit is potentially significant because it comes three months before a United Nations-sponsored climate summit meeting in Paris. China and the United States are the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases, which means that any pact on curbing emissions must have both countries’ support to be effective. Last November in Beijing, Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama announced a landmark agreement that saw China for the first time agree to cap growth in its carbon emissions by 2030.During the telephone call, Mr. Obama expressed appreciation “for President Xi’s commitment to partner in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in achieving a successful outcome at the Paris Climate Summit this December,” the White House statement said.A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: China: President Xi Plans to Visit U.S. in September.
