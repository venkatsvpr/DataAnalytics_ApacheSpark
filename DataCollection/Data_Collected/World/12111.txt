The scope of the disaster in photographs.But residents have complained that the help is not reaching them or is arriving too slowly, and many accuse the government of incompetence, neglect or even corruption.“I don’t think the government is doing anything,” Sudesh Tulachan, a building worker and shop owner sheltering from the rain under a canopy where hundreds of Katmandu residents displaced from their homes gathered, including 24 of his relatives.“Only this tent was provided by the government, but for everything else, we have had to rely on our own labors,” he said as relatives swayed their heads in agreement. “You can see how many humans are in need.”It is a common complaint in the tent camps across Katmandu, the capital, where aftershocks have deterred many residents from sleeping indoors and where many older buildings have crumbled into piles of broken brick.The earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25 flattened sections of Katmandu’s historic center, where many structures were made with bricks.But the government faces a conundrum in distributing aid, one senior military official said. Though urban residents can protest loudly about their hardships, the most pressing needs are in isolated villages in remote valleys and mountainsides, where the earthquake caused devastating landslides. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said on Tuesday that the number killed could reach 10,000.“Our primary, primary, primary goal is to rescue the people,” the official, Brig. Gen. Jagadish Pokharel, a spokesman for the Nepalese Army, told a group of reporters after a briefing on the aid effort. “We are also trying to synchronize it and to distribute to the needy people. We will do our best.”For a government fractured by political rivalries, juggling the demands of distressed citizens could become more difficult if the clean water and other aid fail to flow faster in coming days and blunt public frustration.“The bureaucracy has been a bit slow, but they did seem to get organized in the past 24 hours,” Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations resident coordinator for Nepal, said in a telephone interview.“We’ve got camps with a population we will need to support for the much longer term,” he said. “The material is getting out there, but this is a massive operation.”The hub of the earthquake relief effort in Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport on the outskirts of Katmandu and the adjacent domestic terminal and military quarters. Planes from India, China and other countries have been landing with supplies of water, food, tents, stretchers, medicines and other aid.In the military operations section of the airport, Nepalese officers in mottled fatigues coordinate arrivals of supplies and operate helicopters rescuing badly injured victims of the earthquake from far-off areas. The supplies wait in a warehouse and hangar until civilian government officials allocate them.“We brought in close to 30 tons of drinking water yesterday,” Wing Cmdr. S. S. Birdi, a spokesman for the assisting Indian Air Force, said in an interview at the airport military operations center. “What’s happening is people are all facing hardship, but the people in the remote areas are in much more hardship.”Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.Many Nepalese people have voiced suspicion that much of the assistance has not been shared fairly, or at all, because of incompetence, poor planning or corruption.Hundreds of Nepalis, mostly young men, gathered outside the National Parliament in Katmandu on Monday, chanting in anger at what they said was the government’s slow and inept response to the earthquake, including a lack of safe drinking water.“They have not given anything,” one of the protesters, Sajjwal Chaulagain, a 20-year-old student, said in an interview. He and others echoed the widespread belief that the foreign assistance was plentiful and being hoarded by officials.“This is the corruption and laziness in government,” said Sudip Thebe, a business student who joined the protest. “We look at the news, and every country gives us something, but the Nepal government doesn’t give to us.”Not all Nepalese people were angry with the government, and many spoke of their hardships in weary resignation. “I’m angry with being here, but the government is trying,” said Kabin Joshi, a 20-year-old trainee lab technician staying in one of the camps for residents. “We need more help; that’s a fact.”Some relief organization workers said delivering help to villages devastated by the earthquake was a physical challenge that would test any government. The office of the United Nations’ resident coordinator in Nepal on Monday cited estimates that the earthquake had affected eight million people in the country, including two million in the 11 worst affected districts. About 1.4 million of them needed help with food.“The geography is very, very difficult,” Peter Oyloe, the director for nutrition for Save the Children in Nepal, said in a telephone interview. “Trying to deal with geography, trying to get to those people, the most vulnerable especially up in the high mountains, is very difficult.”In Katmandu, with over a million inhabitants, most residents have been able to find enough to eat, and many people return to their homes to pick up food and perhaps cook a meal. By Tuesday, more shops had reopened, making it easier for residents to buy supplies.But safe drinking water has been more difficult to find, especially for poor residents, after the earthquake fractured pipes and tanks, introducing potential dangerous contaminants.The Nepalese Army has been making a more visible effort to improve people’s conditions in at least some tent camps in Katmandu.On Tuesday at Tundikhel, a parade ground near the center of the city that has been turned into a tent camp, Col. Prayog Rana oversaw soldiers handing packets of cooking oil to women. The soldiers have also built more toilets and cleaned the campsite, which holds 6,000 residents, and they were setting up tanks of disease-free drinking water, he said.“I want to organize this place in a very systematic way,” Colonel Rana said, watching soldiers shepherd the women and children into lines. “But so far there are not the resources.”Chris Buckley reported from Katmandu, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.Advertisement
