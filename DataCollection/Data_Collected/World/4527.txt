The target was launched somewhere above the Mediterranean Sea.The Arrow 3 is intended to be the top tier of Israel’s multilayered air defense system, which has received substantial funding from the United States. The Iron Dome system intercepts less sophisticated, shorter-range rockets like those fired into Israel from Gaza, while another system, David’s Sling, which is expected to become operational soon, is meant to intercept midrange missiles.The Arrow 2 system intercepts ballistic missiles higher up, but is slower than the Arrow 3, which can also maneuver in space, Israeli officials have said.An Arrow 3 test interception was aborted about a year ago because of a problem with the target. The Arrow 2 has been successful in live-fire tests, but has not yet been used in a real field of battle.“One successful test still does not guarantee that the innovative system is already operational and can be deployed in battle conditions,” Ron Ben-Yishai, a military affairs analyst for Ynet, an Israeli news site, wrote on Thursday. “But we, the citizens of Israel, can sleep a bit easier today than last night,” he added.Mr. Ben-Yishai also contended that the international agreement reached this year with Iran to curb its nuclear program, a deal that was strongly denounced by Israel’s leaders, had given Israel a kind of timeout of a few years during which it could more fully develop its defenses.Advertisement
