Citizens are forbidden to hold protests or labor strikes or to travel between the country’s many islands.Foreign Minister Dunya Maumoon said that the measures were “pre-emptive and precautionary” and that airports, transport hubs and tourist resorts are all safe.“The security of our resorts and islands is not under threat and we have received no evidence to suggest otherwise,” she said in a statement.The declaration effectively thwarts plans by the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party to hold a mass rally on Friday in the capital, Male, to demand the release of its jailed leader, former President Mohamed Nasheed.In a statement, the party called for Mr. Yameen’s resignation, saying he has lost control of the country.“His paranoid regime lurches from crisis to crisis,” said a party spokesman, Hamid Abdul Ghafoor.Abbas Faiz, Amnesty International’s Maldives researcher, said that the emergency declaration was surprising and that the government had not given a clear justification for its move.“This must not be an excuse to violate human rights and to silence critics and opponents,” he said.The Maldives has been tense since a Sept. 28 blast on the president’s speedboat and a subsequent series of arrests, including that of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, on suspicion of involvement in the explosion.Mr. Yameen was unhurt by the blast, which the government called an assassination attempt.The Maldives, known for luxury island resorts and beaches, has had a difficult transition to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008, which ended 30 years of autocratic rule by Mr. Yameen’s half-brother.Advertisement
