This is an appalling crime that poses a serious threat to democracy and peace in Myanmar.”Fueled by soaring demand from the growing Chinese middle class, Myanmar’s largest jade quarries, in the war-torn northern state of Kachin, have long been a source of bloody conflict.Members of the military elite and their allies have vied with rebel leaders to control the smuggling of vast quantities of the green stone into neighboring China — Myanmar’s top customer for jade. Caught in the middle are thousands of ethnic Kachin miners and their families, who have fallen victim to an epidemic of heroin addiction, prostitution and H.I.V. that festers around the dangerously unstable earthen pits where they toil.The report’s $31 billion valuation of the country’s official jade production in 2014, based on compilations of Myanmar government data, is far higher than previous estimates.Little of the proceeds trickles down to ethnic Kachin or the rest of Myanmar’s population. Instead, much of the profits flow to military leaders and their allies, who would lose out from a transparent jade trade, the report says. Concealed behind layers of fake companies, secret licensing deals and false owners, it says, are some of the most powerful people in Myanmar, including the family of the former dictator Than Shwe, who ruled with an iron fist from 1992 to 2011.The report includes government jade concession maps and financial records showing that Than Shwe’s sons Kyaing San Shwe and Htun Naing Shwe control two companies that have obtained licenses to six mines in the quarry town of Hpakant. A third company involved in the jade trade is run by an associate of the two brothers who shares a registered address with them. In total, the companies earned $220 million from jade sales at the annual gem emporiums held in the country in 2013 and 2014.The Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, owns two companies that earned $180 million from jade emporium sales in 2014. According to the report, these companies are used as a slush fund to finance the military’s war against Kachin rebel groups, which have fought a decades-long battle for independence and control of jade mining territory.The report says jade profits have also lined the pockets of powerful politicians, crony tycoons with deep ties to the former junta, and drug lords. These figures are said to include Ohn Myint, the minister for livestock, fisheries and rural development, who was previously Myanmar’s northern commander, the top general in Kachin State.Global Witness reported that there were links between some of these figures and multinational corporations that have invested heavily in Myanmar, such as the Coca-Cola Company and Caterpillar Inc., which is deeply involved in selling equipment used in the jade mining industry. Both companies, according to the report, have denied that their partnerships violated American sanctions that were imposed on the crony tycoons and others responsible for human rights abuses or undermining political reforms.The organization has encouraged the Obama administration to push Myanmar to overhaul its jade trade so that the profits can improve the lives of its citizens, some of the world’s poorest.
