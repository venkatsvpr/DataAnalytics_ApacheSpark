It was the first such attack under the country’s leftist-led government, fueling fears of a possible resurgence of domestic terrorism.The blast occurred shortly after 3:30 a.m. on a small, narrow street not far from Parliament and nestled in the capital’s tourist center.Investigators were at the scene before the explosion because an anonymous caller had telephoned a warning to two left-leaning newspapers 40 minutes earlier, according to a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as is customary for the police in Greece.The force of the explosion blew out the windows of several buildings, including the Cypriot Embassy, which closed for the day, and a hotel, which evacuated guests from rooms overlooking the street before the blast.A police official said the bomb had been placed in a black backpack and planted outside the building housing the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, which represents Greece’s large businesses. Bomb disposal experts collected the fragments of the device for analysis, and the road was cordoned off for several hours as police officers scoured the scene for clues that could lead to the perpetrators.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, which resembled similar attacks carried out by Greek guerrilla organizations. Attacks on business and political targets are not unusual in Greece and have peaked in recent years after the onset of the country’s financial crisis in 2010.The attacks are usually symbolic protests and are not intended to cause injuries, hence the anonymous warnings that often precede them. But Tuesday’s explosion was the first since the leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to power in January on a pledge to fight austerity, before reversing course and securing re-election after signing Greece’s third international bailout.Jailed members of Greek domestic guerrilla groups and self-proclaimed anarchists frequently rail against the tough conditions of the country’s bailout agreements with international creditors in statements posted online, accusing successive governments of protecting banks and business interests at the expense of Greek workers and the unemployed.A government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, condemned Tuesday’s blast and called for calm at a critical time for Greece, which has entered a new round of negotiations with its creditors on a new set of austerity measures linked to the third bailout. “The absolute condemnation of such acts, especially at this time, without dangerous interpretations, is the advisable political position,” Ms. Gerovasili said.On Monday, eurozone finance ministers approved the release of 2 billion euros, or about $2.12 billion, in rescue loans to Greece after the authorities legislated a raft of economic changes, including stricter rules for the protection of overly indebted homeowners. Greece has also met the conditions to unlock up to €10 billion that has been set aside for the recapitalization of Greece’s four biggest banks, eurozone officials said. Greek authorities have indicated that less than €6 billion will be needed, because banks have already raised a significant amount of private capital.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
