He was visiting a patient on Wednesday morning when the assailants pulled up behind him on a motorcycle and shot at him.A bullet grazed the back of his head but did not penetrate his skull, said Abu Tabid Mohammad Zillur Rahman, a senior consultant for surgery at Dinajpur Medical College. Police officers recovered a bullet casing from the scene, said Mohammad Ruhul Amin, the superintendent of police in Dinajpur district, which is about 250 miles north of Dhaka, the capital. Mr. Amin said that Mr. Parolari was conscious and that his life was not in danger.Until recently, foreigners have rarely worried that they could be targets in Bangladesh, a vast Sunni Muslim democracy that has had steady economic growth in recent years, driven by a vibrant garment-manufacturing sector.Late in September, intelligence officials from the United States, Britain and Australia said they had information suggesting that terrorists planned to attack foreigners.Days later, on Sept. 29, three men on a motorcycle fatally shot Cesare Tavella, an Italian aid worker, as he jogged through Dhaka’s diplomatic zone. Four days later, a Japanese agriculturalist was shot and killed as he rode a rickshaw to his cropland in northern Bangladesh.Spokesmen for the Islamic State claimed responsibility for both killings within hours, in messages on social media sites including Twitter and Telegram.However, Bangladeshi officials have denied that the Islamic State has a foothold in the country, instead identifying suspects associated with Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party associated with the political opposition.Bangladesh braced for protests on Wednesday as the Supreme Court upheld a death sentence against Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for atrocities committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. Some Bangladeshi analysts have said that the attacks on foreigners had been staged in an attempt to thwart the trial.On Wednesday morning, the government ordered the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission to block Facebook and the messaging apps WhatsApp and Viber “for security reasons,” said Shahjahan Mahmood, the chairman of the commission.Mr. Amin, the Dinajpur police superintendent, said that an investigation was underway but that he suspected the assault on Mr. Parolari “might be a continuation of the attacks on two other foreigners.”He said he had met with missionaries after the earlier killings and had advised them to alert the police before traveling in the region.“They followed our advice, they took help from us, but this morning, the Italian citizen was moving alone by his cycle, and we were not informed,” he said.Indian security officials this week issued a warning to regional leaders, noting that the Islamic State had recently released a recorded message in Bengali, apparently aimed at a Bangladeshi audience, the daily newspaper The Hindu reported.Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.Advertisement
