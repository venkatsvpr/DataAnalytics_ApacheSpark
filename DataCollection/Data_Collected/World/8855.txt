The narration, adapted from a prose poem published last year by Alexei Ivanov, a Russian writer, asserts that Russians have a proud history of improving the lands they invaded and occupied in the past, including Siberia, the Baltic states and Ukraine.“I once occupied Siberia. Now they produce oil, gas, aluminum and other useful stuff,” the narrator says, echoing Kipling’s defense of colonial rule in “The White Man’s Burden.” “Now there are cities with kindergartens and hospitals,” he continues. “Now they can’t sell women for a bundle of sable skins, like it used to be before the Russians.”The two-and-a-half minute film, employing computer animation and graphics in the style of a video game, has been viewed nearly three million times since it was uploaded to social networks over the weekend by a blogger named Evgeny Zhurov in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk.It ends with a pointed rejection of the values of Western nations that have been critical of Russia — including gay rights and the free speech of Russian dissidents — and a bellicose threat to defend national interests with military might, if necessary:“Understand, I do not need your hypocritical ‘freedom,’ I do not need your rotten ‘democracy.’ Everything that you call ‘Western values’ is alien to me. I have other interests! I’ll politely warn you for the last time: Do not mess with me! I build peace, I love peace, but more than anyone I know how to fight.”Dmitri Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister and a former ambassador to NATO known for his provocative gibes at the West on Twitter, brought a copy of the video to the attention of his 493,000 Twitter followers.That endorsement did not escape the attention of Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, one of the Baltic nations described as beneficiaries of Russian occupation in the video.When the Baltics were ruled from Moscow, the video’s narrator argues, their farmland was used to build productive factories. In the post-Soviet era, as part of the European Union, he said, Baltic citizens have been reduced to cleaning the toilets of their Western neighbors.The video’s rosy vision of the Soviet past — eliding any reference to the repression in the Baltics, mismanaged water resources in Central Asia or the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine — was hailed by Russian nationalists, but it evoked less enthusiasm among their neighbors.Advertisement
