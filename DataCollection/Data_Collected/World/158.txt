The arrivals in Greece underscored its new role as the top point of entry to Europe and were more than three times the 131,000 who reached Italy, the No. 2 sea-route destination, so far in 2015. The updated figures, tallied by the United Nations refugee agency, showed that 168,000 people crossed the Mediterranean in September, the highest monthly figure ever recorded and almost five times the volume of a year earlier.
