ATHENS — A guerrilla organization known for targeting political and foreign diplomatic sites in Greece has claimed responsibility for a gun attack on the Israeli Embassy in December, a Greek police official said on Wednesday.In the assault on Dec. 12, gunmen with Kalashnikov rifles opened fire on the Israeli Embassy in a northern suburb of Athens, raking the building with bullets but causing no injuries.An organization called Group of Popular Rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as is customary for the police in Greece. Counterterrorism officers are examining a 19-page statement found on a portable digital storage device left in a trash bin in the southern Athens suburb of Nea Smyrni, he said. The police were alerted in the early hours of Wednesday by staff at a left-leaning newspaper, who received an anonymous call informing them of the location of the device.Police tests on bullet casings found outside the Israeli Embassy after the attack showed the shots were fired from two assault rifles used in a similar attack in December 2013 on the German ambassador’s home, also in the capital’s affluent northern suburbs.AdvertisementGroup of Popular Rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on the ambassador’s home and for a shooting in January 2013 at the offices of the New Democracy party of former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.The guerrilla group is one of several in Greece to have carried out bomb and gun attacks against political and diplomatic targets in recent years, most in protest over austerity measures imposed by the authorities at the behest of Greece’s international creditors. The assaults are usually intended to be symbolic and rarely result in injuries.AdvertisementThe assault on the Israeli Embassy came amid mounting political and financial turmoil in Greece, ahead of elections in January that brought a leftist-led coalition to power. But it was unclear whether the attacks were motivated by domestic developments or by Israel’s policies in the West Bank and Gaza.A version of this article appears in print on February 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Greece: Group Claims Embassy Attack.
