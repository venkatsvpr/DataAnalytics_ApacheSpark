He has also advocated spending cuts of 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) over the next four years, a proposal strongly opposed by Mr. Sipila, who says half the amount would suffice.The leader of the Finns Party, Timo Soini, who has vehemently opposed bailouts for ailing eurozone members and advocates kicking Greece out of the zone, dropped out of government formation talks in 2011 because the other parties supported bailouts.Mr. Soini declined to discuss whether his party would take part in future government talks.Advertisement
