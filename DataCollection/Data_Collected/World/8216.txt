It had initially seemed likely to win the necessary votes from the governing Socialists, despite deep reservations from the party’s left wing.But as the scheduled vote approached on Tuesday, it became clear that the votes for passage might not be there. That, in turn, led Prime Minister Manuel Valls, unwilling to risk defeat, to take the highly unusual step of ramming the legislation through the lower house without a vote, using a constitutional provision that permits sending it directly to the upper house but exposes the government to a confidence vote.“There is probably a majority for this draft,” Mr. Valls, a relative moderate in the party, said, “but it is uncertain. It is my responsibility, and I will not take any risks.”A confidence vote will take place in coming days, but it is highly unlikely to get the absolute majority required to topple the government. The legislation also still has to clear the upper house, the Senate.The proposals for economic liberalization include measures to allow big stores in major tourist areas to open on Sundays and other outlets to offer all-week shopping more frequently.The issue’s political sensitivities reflect decades of a debate across Europe about Sunday shopping that has pitted traditionalists against consumers and retailers.The changes would herald a cultural shift for French citizens used to high levels of state and labor union protection from the bare-knuckled competition common in Britain and the United States. The changes have also come to be seen as a test of commitment by Mr. Hollande to make good on his promises to confront entrenched obstacles to faster growth and more jobs.The package was devised by Emmanuel Macron, the minister of the economy, who says the measures would open a major economy dogged by high unemployment and stagnation.The proposal has divided lawmakers across party lines, prompting protests on the streets and disgruntlement among professionals opposed to deregulation of their jobs.For the millions of foreigners who visit Paris every year, wandering among the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre and the many other tourist attractions, the main impact would be to permit stores in designated tourist zones to open on Sunday until midnight.“Do we want millions and millions of tourists, notably Chinese, who come to the capital to leave us and go and do their shopping in London on a Sunday?” Mr. Valls asked in an interview quoted by Agence France-Presse.But the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist, has described the proposals as a “backward step for democracy.”The other measures in the so-called Macron law would introduce more competition for professionals and white-collar workers, including notaries, bailiffs, court clerks and auctioneers. Long-haul bus lines would be allowed to compete more directly with the French national rail service. And France would sell billions of dollars’ worth of state assets to reduce debt and to invest in the economy.Alan Cowell reported from London, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement
