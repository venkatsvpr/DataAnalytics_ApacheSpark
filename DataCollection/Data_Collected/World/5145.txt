The announcement came as the flow of migrants from Syria continued at crisis levels, part of what the ambassador, Samantha Power, called “a larger global population of displaced that is larger now than 60 million.”“The list of refugees in need unfortunately continues to grow — at the same time the international community has been utterly unable to keep up,” Ms. Power told reporters in New York on Monday. “This year has shown with painful clarity that our existing systems, approaches and funding are inadequate to the task at hand and to the amount of human suffering that is ongoing.”The summit meeting will be held during the annual General Assembly in September and will be the culmination of what Ms. Power called a “vigorous, sustained effort” that will also seek new commitments to help migrants resettle, educate themselves and find jobs. The question of whether the United States should accept refugees from Syria, where the Islamic State is training adherents to carry out attacks in other countries, has set off a searing political debate.Ms. Power said the United States would “continue to welcome refugees.” The country admits about 70,000 refugees from all over the world each year, but it has taken very few Syrians since the start of the conflict there. In large part that is because of lengthy requirements intended to screen for security risks.Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement
