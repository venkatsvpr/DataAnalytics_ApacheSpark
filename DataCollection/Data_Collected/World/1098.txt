Another was abroad and charged in absentia.The case became a rallying point for critics of Ethiopia’s government, which has been accused of stifling free speech.Five defendants were unexpectedly released in July. On Friday, judges in a court in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, decided that for those still imprisoned, “the documents presented by the prosecutor were not sufficient to prove the alleged terrorism,” said Ameha Mekonnen, a defense lawyer in the case.One defendant remains on trial under separate charges of provoking violence.Press freedom advocates welcomed the news. “We are elated that the terrorism charges against the Zone 9 bloggers are dropped,” Tom Rhodes, the East Africa representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. He urged the authorities to abandon its prosecution of the remaining defendant.“Ethiopia should be listening to critical voices to strengthen democracy and development, not jailing them,” Mr. Rhodes said.Advertisement
