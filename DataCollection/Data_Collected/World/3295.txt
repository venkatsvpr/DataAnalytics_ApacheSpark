It said the talks would be led by working-level negotiators to prepare for a full-fledged dialogue that both countries had agreed in August to hold in Seoul or Pyongyang.The two Koreas had agreed to resume senior-level government dialogue as part of the deal in August to end an armed standoff. As part of that agreement, they also held reunions last month that allowed hundreds of aging Koreans separated during the Korean War to meet relatives for the first time in more than six decades.In recent weeks, South Korea has repeatedly proposed starting the government talks, but the North had not responded until Friday.The deal in August came after weeks of high tensions on the peninsula because of land mines that wounded two South Korean border guards. The South accused the North of planting the bombs and, in retaliation, turned on propaganda loudspeakers that had been dormant for years.Advertisement
