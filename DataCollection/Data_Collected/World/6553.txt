The attackers intercepted Mr. Mubarak’s car in Sana, officials said. No information was available late Saturday on Mr. Mubarak’s whereabouts or condition. The abduction appeared to spring from an argument over the contents of Yemen’s draft constitution, which includes provisions to which the Houthis have strongly objected. More important, it pointed to escalating tensions between Mr. Hadi’s government, which is an American ally, and the Houthis, who have forcefully asserted their power since seizing Sana. Houthi leaders portray their actions, which have included firing public officials and demanding oversight of ministries, as attempts to reform Yemen’s corrupt political system. Critics complain about what they say are the Houthis’ strong-arm tactics, including storming government buildings and the homes and offices of their opponents.In a statement, the Houthis called the abduction an “arrest” and said the group was acting in the “national interest.” Their jostling with Mr. Hadi’s government has left the country leaderless at a critical moment, as Al Qaeda’s local affiliate shows new energy and carries out more frequent, deadly attacks.
