Advocates of disarmament and reconciliation with Iran embraced the framework agreement announced Thursday that would limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities, calling it a welcome alternative to war, while the Israeli government and its supporters voiced deep criticism and said the opposite outcome was more likely.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he had told President Obama in a telephone call that “a deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.”In Tehran, news of the framework agreement, which could portend the end to burdensome sanctions on the country, brought no immediate official reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who will have the final word on a completed agreement. But state-run television, in what appeared to be a precedent as well as a sign of top-level approval, broadcast live Mr. Obama’s announcement from the White House about the agreement’s details.The Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan group in Washington, called the framework agreement a “historic breakthrough” that, if fully carried out, would block potential Iranian pathways to a bomb. The group said the agreement “promises to lead to one of the most consequential and far-reaching nuclear nonproliferation achievements in recent decades.”AdvertisementThe National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group in Washington, said that if the framework agreement led to a final deal by June 30, as negotiators hope and expect, it would achieve “through diplomacy what neither war nor sanctions could ever have accomplished.”AdvertisementThe agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, between Iran and the group of powers known as the P5-plus-1 — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — and it contained what disarmament experts said were surprisingly specific provisions.President Obama spoke from the White House on Thursday after a nuclear deal was announced with Iran.Iran agreed to reduce by roughly two-thirds the number of installed centrifuges it has for enriching uranium fuel, and to take other steps to limit its uranium enrichment. It agreed to dismantle and rebuild a reactor so that it would not produce plutonium fuel, and to allow extensive inspections to assure the world of its peaceful intent. In exchange, the P5-plus-1 powers would lift the array of sanctions that have been imposed on Iran for years.In Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy, the official reaction to the framework agreement was, not unexpectedly, harsh and mistrustful.Mr. Netanyahu, an outspoken critic of the nuclear negotiations, reiterated in a statement issued by his office what he had told Congress in Washington last month. “Such a deal would not block Iran’s path to the bomb,” he said. “It would pave it.”He and other Israeli officials sought to cast Iran as an expansionary and deceitful power that is bent on destroying Israel and meddling in Israel’s neighbors.“The smiles in Lausanne are detached from the wretched reality where Iran refuses to make concessions on the nuclear issues and continues to threaten Israel and the rest of the countries of the Middle East,” said Yuval Steinitz, the intelligence minister.The World Jewish Congress, an umbrella group of communities in 100 countries, was less critical, but still highly skeptical. Its president, Ronald S. Lauder, said in a statement that “the key question was if Iran could be trusted to implement the deal.”AdvertisementThe Al Manar broadcasting channel of Hezbollah, the Shiite militant organization in Lebanon that is an important Iranian ally, carried Mr. Obama’s speech and showed a logo of Ayatollah Khamenei and the slogan: “Victory for Steadfastness.”
                Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.            The framework agreement is bound to be seen as a boon by Hezbollah, which relies on Iran for financing and weapons, and has lately claimed to see common interests with the United States in fighting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Hezbollah’s Saudi-backed Sunni political rival in Lebanon, the Future Movement, has been wary of an Iran deal.Syria’s state news agency did not immediately react. But the deal would most likely help President Bashar al-Assad of Syria by lifting sanctions on Iran, which has subsidized Syria’s government in a civil war now four years old.Mr. Assad’s opponents by and large argue that the United States has sacrificed them and their movement in order to prioritize the Iran deal.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
