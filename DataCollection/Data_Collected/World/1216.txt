ISTANBUL — Desperately seeking help to contain Europe’s migrant crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Sunday explicitly linked accelerating Turkey’s effort to join the European Union to Turkish cooperation in clamping down on the flow of refugees from Turkey to Europe.Ms. Merkel, who has long opposed Turkey’s admission to the bloc, said she would support speeding up the process, a concession that underscored the importance European leaders place on Turkey’s cooperation in trying to contain what has become the largest flow of migrants since World War II, as people flee violence and deprivation in the Middle East and Africa.“No country can shoulder the refugee burden alone,” Ms. Merkel said at a news conference with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey in Istanbul on Sunday. “The job has to be shared.”For weeks, a deal in principle between Europe and Turkey has been discussed: it would include almost three billion euros, or about $3.4 billion, to help Turkey deal with nearly 2.2 million refugees, mostly from Syria, who now live in Turkey. At the news conference, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Davutoglu said no agreement had been finalized and that the details were still being worked out.AdvertisementMr. Davutoglu continued to press for a “safe zone” in northern Syria, a longstanding priority for Turkey that has been met largely by silence from the international community, because it would require a substantial military operation.AdvertisementMr. Davutoglu said: “Our priority is to prevent illegal immigration and reduce the number of people crossing our borders. In that respect, we have had very fruitful discussions with the E.U.”
                The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.            He said he hoped that Turkish prime ministers could once again attend European Union summit meetings, noting that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, went to one in 2004 as prime minister, but then such visits stopped. “We hope Turkey will take a place in the E.U. family photo,” Mr. Davutoglu said.In the early evening, Ms. Merkel met with Mr. Erdogan, Turkey’s pre-eminent decision maker, and they also discussed the migrant crisis, as well as the European Union accession process and counterterrorism.In a statement, Mr. Erdogan said he had asked Ms. Merkel for support in accelerating Turkey’s efforts to join the union.From the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Turkey has had an open-door policy for refugees and has spent billions of dollars caring for them. Now that Europe has been drawn into the crisis, Turkish leaders have been quick to point out that Turkey had been “left alone in recent years,” as Mr. Davutoglu put it on Sunday.In the negotiations, Turkey has made visa-free travel to Europe for its citizens a top priority, and Ms. Merkel said she had agreed to push that issue forward. Turkey is the only country that has been formally accepted for possible membership in the union whose citizens must have visas to travel to Europe.Turkey has long sought to join the European Union — formal talks began in 2005 — but the process has stalled in recent years, partly because of European concerns about Turkey’s human rights record and a government crackdown on the news media and freedom of expression.
                In recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.            Now, though, the balance of power has shifted in Turkey’s favor. Europe needs Turkey, which hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, to stem the flow of refugees and migrants who are leaving Turkey’s shores for Greece and then toward other countries on the Continent. So the concerns about rights are largely unspoken by European leaders at the moment.AdvertisementFor example, a European Union report on Turkey, part of the accession process, that was expected to be deeply critical of Ankara’s record on free speech, has been delayed.This has raised criticisms from analysts and activists who say that Europe is willing to overlook the increasing authoritarianism of the Turkish government in exchange for cooperation on the migrant problem. Ms. Merkel’s visit took place less than two weeks before snap elections in which Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party aims to regain its parliamentary majority, which it lost in a vote in June.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We have seen waves of arrests of political activists under vague antiterror laws and further attacks on freedom of expression, with a spike in the number of cases of ill treatment of detainees.”This criticism has been echoed by some European leaders.Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said recently in an interview: “I actually think the E.U. is not vocal enough in expressing the deep concerns over the rule of law and restrictions of people’s rights and freedoms in Turkey. Often when I speak with people in Turkey, they get a sense that the E.U. is blind to the deep polarization and tension in society.”Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
