MOSCOW — The mystery deepened Monday over the weekend crash of a Russian charter plane on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt that killed all 224 aboard, with company executives ruling out technical or human error only to be upbraided by aviation officials who called such assertions premature.As representatives from at least five countries joined the investigation of the Airbus jetliner crash, new questions also arose about the aircraft’s repair history and the possibility that a terrorist act felled it on Saturday.The Metrojet flight full of mostly Russian vacationers, bound for St. Petersburg from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh, plummeted after having reached cruising altitude, scattering in chunks and bits across almost eight square miles.The lack of information has been exacerbated by unsubstantiated claims from the Islamic State that its militants destroyed the aircraft to avenge colleagues killed by Russia’s immersion into the Syria war.AdvertisementSenior officials at Metrojet, the charter company that operated the aircraft, sounded definitive in their statements that the plane and crew were faultless.Advertisement“We absolutely exclude the technical failure of the plane, and we absolutely exclude pilot error or a human factor,” Aleksandr A. Smirnov, a former pilot and the airline’s deputy director for aviation, told a packed news conference in Moscow.Mr. Smirnov said that the crash could have been caused by “an external impact on the plane,” although he did not endorse the theory of a terrorist attack, either, saying that the investigation would have to determine the cause.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia asked investigators to work with Egyptian and other authorities in determining what caused the plane crash on the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 people.Company officials used only assertive statements to support their position, and they did not provide any documentation to back their claim that both the plane and its personnel were in top flying condition.Hours after the Metrojet news conference, the Russian government contradicted the company’s assertions.“Such a statement is premature and is not based on any real facts,” Alexander Neradko, the head of the federal Air Transportation Agency, said on the Rossiya-24 news channel. “Much more work will have to be done on a detailed study of the plane’s constructive elements; flight recorders will have to be deciphered and analyzed.”Mr. Neradko also said Egypt was keeping tight control over data from the flight recorders and other instruments. “The Egyptian commission is conducting the investigation, and is giving no records and transcripts, be it of the flight recorders or on-ground recorders or radar data, to anyone,” he said.Mohamed Rahma, a spokesman for Egypt’s civil aviation ministry, said on Monday that Egyptian investigators had all but finished the work of recovering the bodies.AdvertisementOfficials in Russia said 130 bodies and 40 body parts had arrived on Monday. Another plane of remains was scheduled for Tuesday.Metrojet officials also dismissed claims by the Islamic State that its operatives had felled the plane. The officials said that a blurry video purporting to show a missile strike on the plane appeared to be fake.American intelligence officials, as well, have expressed skepticism about the assertion by the Islamic State. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, separately said at a security conference in Washington on Monday that American spy and security agencies so far have no evidence that points to terrorism as the cause of the Russian airliner crash.
                A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.            But other analysts have not discounted the possibility that a bomb had been brought aboard or stowed in the luggage. A bomb in the hold of a Pan Am Boeing 747 en route to New York from London exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, bringing down the plane and killing 270 people in a terrorist attack attributed to Libya.The statements and lack of definitive facts further muddled what was known about the Metrojet crash, the latest in a string of disasters to befall Egypt’s troubled tourism industry.Sharm el Sheikh, a sparkling resort on the Red Sea, has been relatively insulated from the turmoil in Egypt because of the extraordinary measures taken to ensure security. Whether tourists may now avoid it is unclear.President Vladimir V. Putin, who established an investigative committee, on Monday spoke for the first time about the crash, calling it a “huge tragedy.”In a meeting with Maxim Sokolov, the minister of transportation, who had just returned from Egypt, the president repeated his call for a “thorough inquiry.”AdvertisementMetrojet officials said at the news conference that the pilots had given no indication that the plane was in trouble and had not sent any type of distress call.Mr. Smirnov, Metrojet’s deputy director of aviation, asserted, again without indicating his source, that the plane’s airspeed had slowed significantly and that it suddenly dropped 5,000 feet in altitude one minute before it crashed. Wild fluctuations in the plane’s altitude and airspeed in its final 20 seconds could indicate that the pilots were struggling to control the Airbus 321-200, he added.He also suggested that the sudden decompression of the plane as it broke apart most likely incapacitated all aboard immediately.Aviation experts expressed disbelief that airline officials presented such strong assertions even as the investigation was barely starting.“Without the flight recorders’ having been read, and without more investigation of the fuselage, which is spread all over the place, I don’t think you can rule out anything,” said Robert T. Francis, a former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States.At the news conference, the airline, founded as Kogalymavia but flying under the name Metrojet, rejected criticism that the airplane was too old to fly. It also rejected the possibility that a tail strike in 2001 during a landing in Cairo, when the aircraft was operated by a different airline, might have left fatal structural flaws.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Averianov, Metrojet’s deputy director for engineering, ruled out both as possible factors during the hourlong news conference at the company’s headquarters in an office park in Moscow.The 18-year-old Airbus A321-200 had flown just 57,000 hours of its 120,000-hour life span, Mr. Averianov said, adding that this was not an “extraordinary” age compared with other European and Russian fleets. He also dismissed the tail strike as an issue.“I am absolutely confident that this incident could not be the reason for what has happened because the plane was repaired by its manufacturer,” Mr. Averianov said. “Airbus has developed special technology for such repairs which guarantees the usage of such an airplane.”AdvertisementHe said that the tail had been checked every 24 months and that any cracks or metal fatigue would have been discovered because such issues develop slowly.Airbus declined to comment, citing the investigation. A spokeswoman for AerCap, the Netherlands-based company that owned the aircraft and had leased it to Metrojet, did not return calls.An official with Metrojet — whose plane crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Saturday, killing 224 people — ruled out any technical failure or human error on the part of the airline in the catastrophe.There have been at least two previous cases in which airplanes either broke apart or became unmanageable long after similar tail repairs were done.A China Airlines Boeing 747 en route to Hong Kong from Taiwan in May 2002 broke into several pieces as it was climbing to 35,000 feet, killing all 225 people on board. The repairs made 22 years earlier on the tail failed, causing a sudden and explosive decompression, according to the analysis by the Taiwanese government.A Japan Airlines 747 had a similar failure in 1985, seven years after a tail strike had been repaired. The crew struggled to control the plane for 46 minutes after takeoff before it crashed, killing all but four of the 524 people on board.A different type of crash, involving a spark in a fuel tank, broke apart a TWA jumbo jet as it was ascending off Long Island in July 1996, killing all 230 on board.Responding to accusations that the co-pilot had complained to his family about the technical state of the plane soon before the plane left, Mr. Averianov said there were no recent remarks in the logbook, and he said that the plane departed on schedule from Sharm el Sheikh, indicating it had not been delayed by technical issues.The airplane officials said they had provided documents to the Investigative Committee, a government body looking into any possible negligence of Russian law, to bolster its case.AdvertisementBut he repeated what senior transportation officials said a day earlier: The widely scattered debris field, almost eight square miles, indicated that the plane had broken apart at a great height.Russia has long been concerned about Islamic militant attacks against it. The Russians have fought a long-running Islamic insurgency in Chechnya, where two women armed with hand grenades destroyed two separate domestic flights in 2004.More important, Russia recently deployed its armed forces in Syria to defend the rule of President Bashar al-Assad and to attack his opponents, including the Islamic State. That prompted calls for a global jihad against Russia.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the effect of failed repairs on a Japan Airlines 747 in 1985. The failure made the plane unmanageable; they did not cause the plane to break apart.Reporting was contributed by Andrew E. Kramer and Alexandra Odynova from St. Petersburg, Russia; Nicola Clark from Paris; Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong; Eric Schmitt from Washington; Kareem Fahim from Cairo; and Rick Gladstone from New York.A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Russian Regulators Challenge Airline’s Assessment of Deadly Crash in Sinai .
