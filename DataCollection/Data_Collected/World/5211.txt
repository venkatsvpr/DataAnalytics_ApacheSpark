It gives us peace of mind in case we develop severe health problems.AdvertisementSurabhi Srivastava, 26, in New Delhi.I now use sort of a scarf every day to cover my nose and mouth, but it has more psychological benefits than actual practical benefits in terms of protecting myself from the harmful air I breathe.

Michelle Chung, 23, in New York, grew up in Beijing.We would often take public transportation, but now that is just not worth the extended exposure to the outside air. My family no longer opens their windows. Ironically, fresh air does not come from outside. It comes from the four air purifiers we have in every corner of our house.
