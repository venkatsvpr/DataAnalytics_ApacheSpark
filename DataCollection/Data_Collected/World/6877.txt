Video posted by antigovernment activists showed bloody victims, burning buildings, destroyed market stalls, and corpses, including the burned body of a small child. The government said via the official news agency, Sana, that it had carried out operations against terrorists.The continuing attacks come as the United Nations is pushing for a freeze in fighting in the northern city of Aleppo, the government is continuing its strategy of seeking local cease-fires and Russia is trying to convene a new round of peace talks set to start in Moscow on Monday. Several opposition groups have said they would not attend the talks organized by Russia, the most powerful ally of the Syrian government.Last week, government forces evacuated nearly 4,000 people from the town of Douma, just north of Damascus, and a rare delivery of United Nations aid was allowed to enter the area. Footage showed emaciated and exhausted-looking people leaving Douma. Sana reported that they had been kept there against their will by “terrorists.”Some local residents, on the other hand, said in interviews that they had left in desperation because of a lack of food and medicine inside Douma, and that fighting-age men were forced to join government forces in order to leave. Numerous Ghouta residents said that young men were being pushed to join a force called Jaish al-Wafa, or the Loyalty Army, a newly organized pro-government militia.Mohammad Sallh al-Deen, an opposition activist in the Ghouta town of Erbin, said via Skype that the attack in Hamouriyeh was meant to step up pressure on more people to agree to be evacuated, a strategy the government has used in the central city of Homs and in Damascus suburbs like Moadhamiyeh.“It was the strongest attack in a long time,” he said, citing contacts in Hamouriyeh. “Carnage is everywhere in town.” He put the death toll at 50 people, including six children. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain and working with a network of local contacts, put the toll at 46, including six children.He said he believed President Bashar al-Assad’s forces were stepping up attacks “because it wants them to give up and leave Ghouta under his supervision, so the youths will join the Loyalty Army. This way Bashar will kill the revolt completely in Ghouta.”Earlier in the week, a car bomb killed 15 people, mostly college students, in a government-held section of Homs that insurgents have repeatedly hit, and the northeastern province of Qamishli suffered one of its highest single death tolls in the nearly four-year-old civil war. Government airstrikes hit a market in Tal Hamis. Two local activists, giving their names as Mosaab and Amir, said in Skype interviews that 70 bodies had been identified and that 13 others were burned beyond recognition, with more than 100 wounded.State media said Islamic State fighters were the targets of the airstrikes, but the activists said that civilians and fighters with the Kurdish militias known as the People’s Protection Units were among the dead.In Lebanon, the army said in a statement that five soldiers had died in clashes that also killed many militants on the outskirts of Ras Baalbek, north of Arsal, the Lebanese border town where Syrian insurgents and allied foreign fighters have formed a stronghold.Lebanon, which is deeply divided over the war in Syria, has worked hard to keep wholesale war from spilling over, but the army and Hezbollah militants have increasingly fought running battles with Syrian insurgents along the mountainous border.Mohammad Ghannam and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement
