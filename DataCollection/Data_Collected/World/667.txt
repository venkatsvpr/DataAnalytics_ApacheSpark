The National Dialogue Quartet, made up of four organizations, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for aiding in the transition to democracy in the North African country.LONDON —  A coalition of labor union leaders, businesspeople, lawyers and human rights activists won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for what the Nobel committee called “its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011.”The prize to the coalition, known as the National Dialogue Quartet, comes nearly five years after an unemployed street vendor set himself on fire, touching off a political earthquake that toppled Tunisia’s longtime authoritarian president and proceeded to reverberate throughout the Middle East and North Africa.Among the disappointments of what has become known as the Arab Spring — collapsed states in Libya, Syria and Yemen; the return of rule by a military strongman in Egypt; and the rise of the Islamic State in the sectarian caldron of Syria and Iraq — the relative success of Tunisia’s transition to democracy has been a wisp of hope.The quartet comprises four organizations: the Tunisian General Labor Union; the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts; the Tunisian Human Rights League; and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. But the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasized that the prize “is awarded to this quartet, not to the four individual organizations as such.”Advertisement“The Arab Spring originated in Tunisia in 2010 and 2011, but it quickly spread to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East,” said Kaci Kullmann Five, the chairwoman of the committee, who announced the prize in Oslo. “In many of these countries, the struggle for democracy and human rights has come to a standstill or suffered setbacks. Tunisia, however, has seen a democratic transition based on a vibrant civil society, with demands for respect for basic human rights.”In Tunisia, the winners rejoiced. “Congratulations to Tunisia, to the quartet and to all parties that facilitated the mission of the quartet,” the labor union’s secretary general, Houcine Abassi, told Radio Mosaïque FM. “This prize came at the right time, because our country is still threatened by different security challenges.”AdvertisementThe president of the Human Rights League, Abdessattar Ben Moussa, told the radio station, “It proves that dialogue is the only way to solve a crisis and not weapons.”In a Facebook video, President Beji Caid Essebsi called the award a triumph of negotiation over violence. “Tunisia has no other solution but dialogue,” he said. “We are facing a war against terrorism, and we can’t win unless we stay together.”
            A coalition in Tunisia has won the Nobel Peace Prize, the 96th to be awarded since 1901.        Tunisia, a former French colony that achieved independence in 1956, has been the crucible of momentous change since the street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire on Dec. 17, 2010, spurring massive demonstrations.An Islamist party, Ennahda, won the most votes the next year in Tunisia’s first free parliamentary elections, but its proposal for a new constitution that would weaken women’s status as equal to men, among other changes, drew widespread protests. The assassination of two opposition politicians in 2013 led to calls for the Ennahda-led government to step down, and by the end of the year it had agreed to a timetable for a democratic transition, becoming the only Islamist-led government created during the Arab Spring to cede power willingly.The quartet was successful because it represented a credible third party that could guarantee the agreement. Having seen the Muslim Brotherhood government deposed in Egypt, Tunisia’s Islamists feared a similar fate. Although the Islamists did not trust their political opponents, they reportedly did trust Mr. Abassi, the union leader.Participants have commented that Tunisia was lucky in that no single group in the country was strong enough to consider enforcing its own hegemony. Unlike in Egypt, the Tunisian Army — always kept weak under Mr. Ben Ali’s dictatorship — was not in a position to take power. Nor could members of the former government, or its more democratic opponents, overthrow the Islamist-led government.AdvertisementOn Friday, the Ennahda Party congratulated the quartet on the prize. “It honors the efforts of the quartet, and it also honors Tunisia, which, thanks to God and the efforts of Tunisia’s children, succeeded in preventing the killing and fighting for power that are happening in neighboring countries,” the party’s leader, Rached Ghannouchi, wrote in a Facebook post.In Oslo, Ms. Five said that the 2013 achievement was decisive in the Nobel committee’s thinking. “The quartet paved the way for a peaceful dialogue between the citizens, the political parties and the authorities, and helped to find consensus-based solutions to a wide range of the challenges across political and religious divides,” she said.However, the current peace in Tunisia — overseen by an alliance of secular liberals, trade unionists and some officials from the former Ben Ali era — is still fragile. In March, Islamist extremists stormed the National Bardo Museum in Tunis, killing 21 tourists and a police officer, and in June, an Islamist gunman killed 38 people at a beachside resort in Sousse. Most of the victims were tourists, and the attacks shattered what had been a pillar of the economy. The government has moved to shut mosques thought to be associated with extremists.At the Nobel announcement, officials deflected questions from reporters about the Islamic State and other extremist groups, though Ms. Five acknowledged, “We want to prove that it is possible for Islamist and secular political movements to work together in the best interests of the people.”Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Bayeux, France, and Farah Samti from Tunis.A version of this article appears in print on October 10, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Peace Prize Goes to Tunisian Group for Backing Democracy After Arab Spring.
